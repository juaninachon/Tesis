Significant group differences were found on literacy measures, tasks of inhibition and executive function, but not verbal working memory measures. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that children with hyperactivity have difficulty in behavioural inhibition, and the previously reported high incidence of comorbidity between reading impairment and attention disorders. However, the data suggest that the core cognitive deficits in executive function that are associated with hyperactivity in children are independent of the phonological deficits associated with reading impairment.}

These efforts were motivated by providing researchers with a set of measures that assess EF subcomponents while also accounting for the dynamic social processes present in group settings. These assessments take place in schools, are relatively simple to administer, and include multiple EF indicators. Drawing on a diverse sample of 283 kindergarteners (Mage~=~5.8~years, SD~=~0.38), we found that group-based EF assessments were significantly related to individually assessed EF measures and differentially predicted children’s performance on standardized tests of math and reading achievement. Overall, this study represents a first step toward developing a set of group-based EF measures that are appropriate for use with young children.},

  abstract = {Two studies of word learning in 24-month-old children are reported, one involving an object word (Study 1) and one involving an action word (Study 2). In both studies, non-verbal scripts of playing with novel objects/actions in particular ways were established before the child was exposed to any language models. Following this pre-training, children heard an experimenter announce her intention to either find an object or perform an action. In the referent condition, children then saw the intended referent (object or action) immediately after hearing the language model. Children in the absent referent condition experienced the same non-verbal scripts and language models, but never saw the referent object or action after hearing the language model: at the appropriate juncture in the script they were told that the toy barn in which the target object had been previously located was “locked”, or that the toy character who had previously performed the target action was missing. Comparisons with two control conditions indicated that children were able to learn words for a novel object and a novel action in both the referent and absent referent conditions and, moreover, that learning was equivalent in these two conditions. These results show quite clearly that early lexical acquisition does not depend on temporal contiguity between word and referent—or indeed any perceptual pairing between word and referent at all—but rather it relies on children's active understandings of a speaker's referential intentions in particular discourse contexts.}

  abstract = {Identifying what is, and what is not an advertisement is the first step in realizing that an advertisement is a marketing message. Children can distinguish television advertisements from programmes by about 5 years of age. Although previous researchers have investigated television advertising, little attention has been given to advertisements in other media, even though other media, especially the Internet, have become important channels of marketing to children. We showed children printed copies of invented web pages that included advertisements, half of which had price information, and asked the children to point to whatever they thought was an advertisement. In two experiments we tested a total of 401 children, aged 6, 8, 10 and 12 years of age, from the United Kingdom and Indonesia. Six-year-olds recognized a quarter of the advertisements, 8-year-olds recognized half the advertisements, and the 10- and 12-year-olds recognized about three-quarters. Only the 10- and 12-year-olds were more likely to identify an advertisement when it included a price. We contrast our findings with previous results about the identification of television advertising, and discuss why children were poorer at recognizing web page advertisements. The performance of the children has implications for theories about how children develop an understanding of advertising.}

  abstract = {Understanding figurative language develops during middle childhood. Drawing can facilitate recall and may aid other aspects of linguistic expression. We examined whether children provide more symbolic interpretations of figurative statements in drawings relative to verbal explanations, and whether drawing facilitates overall symbolic interpretation. Ninety-six children were split into three age groups (5–6, 7–8, and 9–10 years) in a between-subjects design. In the ‘draw-first’ condition, they were asked to depict then explain figurative statements (e.g., raining like cats and dogs), and in the ‘explain-first’ condition, children were asked to explain before drawing. We coded for symbolic or literal content. Overall, children provided more symbolic responses for verbal explanations compared to drawings, with a developmental increase. More symbolic responses occurred in the ‘draw-first’ condition compared to other task by condition combinations, suggesting drawing can facilitate subsequent symbolic verbal explanation. We discuss the links between drawings, figurative language, and development. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Understanding figurative language such as metaphor develops during childhood. Drawing has been shown to aid recall and may aid other aspects of linguistic expression. What the present study adds? Drawing figurative expressions facilitates subsequent symbolic verbal explanations. Children provide more symbolic interpretations in verbal explanations compared to drawings. There is a developmental progression in these abilities.},

Parent-reported child sport participation, screen time, and personality traits were measured at baseline and again 24 months later. Young children who were more active recorded more of a decrease in introversion, less of a decrease in persistence, and less of an increase in reactivity, than those who were less active. Older children who were more active recorded less of an increase in introversion and more of an increase in persistence than those who were less active. In addition, young children who continued participation in extracurricular sport had greater intra-individual stability of personality for introversion. These finding suggest that an active lifestyle might help to facilitate desirable personality trait stability and change during childhood.},

A sample of 194 children was tested on measures of working memory, phonological awareness, and non-verbal ability, in addition to the school-based baseline assessments in the areas of reading, writing, mathematics, speaking and listening, and personal and social development. Various aspects of cognitive functioning formed unique associations with baseline assessments; for example complex memory span with rated writing skills, phonological short-term memory with both reading and speaking and listening skills, and sentence repetition scores with both mathematics and personal and social skills. Rated reading skills were also uniquely associated with phonological awareness scores. The findings indicate that the capacity to store and process material over short periods of time, referred to as working memory, and also the awareness of phonological structure, may play a crucial role in key learning areas for children at the beginning of formal education.}

While both child sex and parenting are related to child EC, and while a literature shows early sex differences in children's responses to care, interactions between care and child sex in predicting EC are not well understood. We therefore examined associations between child sex and early caregiving as predictors of children's development of a specific aspect of EC, inhibitory control (IC). A community sample of 406 three-year-old children and their caregivers completed behavioural tasks and observational measures of parenting and IC, and children were re-assessed for IC at age 5. Results showed that early care influenced change in IC over time, although caregiving was a more important influence on boys' IC than girls; specifically, differences in boys' and girls' IC at age 5 were modest when parenting was positive. The implications of a better understanding of sex differences in associations between parenting and the development of IC in early childhood are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? While sex differences in reactivity to early care in the development of externalizing symptoms have been explored, very little is known about such differences in children's early-emerging effortful control. What does this study add? Using a longitudinal design and independent, laboratory methods of assessing study constructs, we provide new information showing that early care appears to differentially influence boys' development of inhibitory control, a key aspect of effortful control, in early childhood.},

  abstract = {We report an experiment that investigates the relationship between speed of information processing and development. The goal of the experiment was to compare developmental changes at two stages of processing—response selection and stimulus categorization. The experiment compared developmental change on three kinds of reaction time task. The first was a standard Jensen (1982) procedure which separates the decision and motor components of reaction time, the second was a modification of this procedure suggested by Smith \& Carew (1987) to control for possible anticipatory strategies, and the third was a more traditional reaction time task where each stimulus is paired with a unique response (lights-to-keys). Age changes in speed of information processing were found for the lights-to-keys task but not for either of the Jensen tasks. We argue that this is because the lights-to-keys task taps response selection factors that change with age and that are orthogonal to differences in speed of stimulus categorization indexed by the standard Jensen task. If the latter is taken as the purer index of speed of processing then we conclude that speed of processing does not change with age.}

Seventeen articles were selected and, following an analysis, these were divided into two groups. The first group included articles that evaluated ER strategies.

The stimulus shape had to be remembered and reproduced after either multimodal visual-kinaesthetic stimulation or unimodal visual or kinaesthetic input only. Drawing took place either with or without visual guidance of the drawing hand. Drawing skill was assessed according to the dimensions of shape, size and orientation as well as movement control. It was found that in general the presence of visual input information was more helpful for those without than for those with Down's syndrome in shape approximation. In contrast, Down's syndrome subjects tended to make better use of kinaesthetically derived information, especially in regard to orientation and movement control.}

This line of reasoning entails an implicit assumption, i.e. an infant will not search if no object is seen to disappear. This assumption was evaluated in three studies of 9- and 12-month-old infants' responses to ‘hiding’ toy and ‘no toy’ in different orders in one and two positions. The infants did not search for ‘no toy’ when it preceded toy hiding, but they did search for ‘no toy’ when it followed ‘toy’ under some conditions.}

Three settings, two in Africa and one in Sweden, have been chosen to represent cultural variation in pedagogic practices and child rearing ideologies. A total of 329 children in a traditional school setting in Tanzania, an ANC refugee settlement and a Swedish small-town setting drew pictures illustrating “When I'm working in my classroom”. The Swedish children produced more self-centred (child-centred) representations of classroom life (larger-scale pupils, more detailed, central pupils, and less distance between teacher and pupil figures) than either of the African groups. The children in the traditional teacher-centred culture (the Tanzanian group) drew the most socio-centric and least child-centred representations, whereas children in the ANC settlement produced drawings that were intermediate. Differences in social scaling (size, detailing, centrality and distance scaling) were thus related to cultural differences in pedagogic practices and child-rearing ideologies. The results are discussed in terms of cultural variation in representations of social space.}

Overall, children's baseline emotions (i.e. outside of disputes) and their emotions during disputes were somewhat interrelated, and these emotion displays were associated with children's participation in disputes with their peers, and to a lesser degree their continued post-dispute interactions. Emotion intensity was also related to rates of peer disputes. These findings were qualified, however, by the type of dispute (aggressive vs. non-aggressive conflicts) and the context of participants' emotions (baseline vs. dispute-related emotions). Overall, emotions were most clearly linked with children's initiation of aggression, and a combination of percentage baseline anger, aggression-related anger, and aggression-related happiness predicted nearly a quarter of the variance in children's initiation of aggression.}

Children's emotional expectancies varied with the socio-moral rule system and event participant (actor vs. recipient) being assessed. In addition, BD and typical children differed in some of the emotions and rationales they anticipated as outcomes. Group differences were most pronounced for inhibitory (victimization) and prosocial morality. Compared to their peers, BD children minimized the fear associated with victimization, and explained victimizers' emotions with more references to desirable material and psychological consequences, and fewer references to the loss, harm, and unfairness that victimizers had created. BD children were also more likely to attribute prosocial actors' emotions to the harm, loss, and unfairness that had been avoided, and to provide fewer references to the beneficial outcomes created for recipients. Overall, BD children were also more likely than typical children to select sadness as an emotional outcome. Discussion focused on the potential role of atypical emotional expectancies in perpetuating BD children's maladaptive patterns of socio-moral behaviour.}

  abstract = {A major goal of education in elementary mathematics is the mastery of arithmetic operations. However, research on subtraction is rather scarce, probably because subtraction is often implicitly assumed to be cognitively similar to addition, its mathematical inverse. To evaluate this assumption, we examined the relation between the borrow effect in subtraction and the carry effect in addition, and the developmental trajectory of the borrow effect in children using a choice reaction paradigm in a longitudinal study. In contrast to the carry effect in adults, carry and borrow effects in children were found to be categorical rather than continuous. From grades 3 to 4, children became more proficient in two-digit subtraction in general, but not in performing the borrow operation in particular. Thus, we observed no specific developmental progress in place-value computation, but a general improvement in subtraction procedures. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The borrow operation increases difficulty in two-digit subtraction in adults. The carry effect in addition, as the inverse operation of borrowing, comprises categorical and continuous processing characteristics. What does this study add? In contrast to the carry effect in adults, the borrow and carry effects are categorical in elementary school children. Children generally improve in subtraction performance from grades 3 to 4 but do not progress in place-value computation in particular.},

Considering evidence, the key issue of children's understanding of false belief is first discussed. Then other evidence for children's folk psychological understanding is summarized, from late infancy to the end of the preschool period. Considering explanations, the dominant idea in the field, the ‘heory theory’, is discussed first. Then five other perspectives are considered: enculturation, nativism, folk psychology based on procedural knowledge, on experience, or on scripts. The positions, and the empirical predictions each would make, are compared. The paper concludes with a synthesis of the different views and a brief consideration of where the field is headed.}

Research and theory suggest that children with strong regulatory skills may be better equipped to manage the complex academic, social, and emotional demands of early learning and school environments; and alternatively, deficits in regulatory skills can lead to problems in school adjustment, academic outcomes, and other measures of well-being. In this paper, we bring together two regulationrelated research traditions: executive function (EF) and effortful control (EC). We highlight the common features of EF and EC and their key differences. Building on findings from these two research traditions, we propose an integrated model of regulation for school-based interventions and other applied settings that can serve as an organizing framework for a broad set of skills across the cognitive, social, and emotion domains that are critical to school success. Using a developmental psychopathology framework, we illustrate how an integrated model of regulation can inform more nuanced and targeted approaches to research, policy, and intervention for both special and universal populations. We end the paper with a set of recommendations for the next decade of developmental and prevention research focused on self-regulation.},

Performance was compared to developmental norms. Results show, that children with perceptuo-motor dysfunction are heterogeneous, and have various ways of carrying out a motor action. Some do not plan a movement, others do not control an ongoing movement like their peers. Yet despite marked abnormalities some children can compensate and be very accurate. Kinaesthetic disability is associated with motor disability. Process-orientated treatment—including kinaesthetic training—improves motor functioning in some domains more than others.}

Hand movement was analysed in terms of: the speed and direction of the initial part of the response; ongoing modifications to the speed and path of movement; the speed and accuracy of the hand when close to the target. Results showed that the speed with which the hand moved initially was planned specifically for the target's speed and trajectory, while the direction of movement was planned only roughly. During the movement, there was usually only one adjustment to the speed of the hand, but frequent adjustments to the path of movement. The data show there are two important stages in the development of reaching to targets of different speed. By 8 years there is an advance in ability to plan a movement, while at 10 years there is development in ability to control the ongoing movement.}

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the development of analogical reasoning abilities in 5- and 6-year-old children. Our particular interest relates to the way in which analogizing is influenced by the provision of task-based feedback coupled with a self-explanation requirement. Both feedback and self-explanation provide children with opportunities to engage in self-reflective thinking about the process of analogical reasoning. To examine the role of such metacognitive factors in analogical strategy development the reported study combined a proportional analogy paradigm with a small-scale microgenetic approach involving multiple testing sessions over a restricted time period. The key manipulation involved exposing participants either to the correct or incorrect analogy completions of another reasoner that they were then asked to explain. The data revealed that the development of an effective analogizing strategy embodying a ‘relational shift’ from superficial to relational responding was modulated by the feedback condition that the child was placed in, with a negative feedback intervention providing the greatest developmental benefit. We suggest that the value of negative feedback for the acquisition of analogical reasoning abilities derives from the way in which a self-reflective analysis of the reasons for erroneous responses sensitizes the child to a deeper understanding of how to make effective relational mappings.}

A sample of 4- to 6-year-olds was used to test our hypothesis that self-presentational display rules involve recursive cognition about others’ mental states. Children completed a task measuring understanding of various display rules and additionally performed a second-order false-belief task. Results supported the hypothesis that an appreciation of second-order mental representation is associated with understanding self-presentational display rules but not with understanding prosocial display rules (designed to spare others’ feelings). We discuss the likely interaction of social processes with the observed changes in mental-state understanding in relation to the development of self-presentation.}

  abstract = {Previous research has shown that children's understanding of how others evaluate them improves during primary school. Modesty reflects a complex form of this understanding, since one must appreciate that a self-deprecating presentation of the self can lead to enhanced social evaluation. The present research examines the understanding of modesty in children aged between 6 and 10 years. In Expt 1, 179 children were asked to choose between modest and immodest responses to praise in hypothetical situations, and then to justify their choices. Children from age 8 onwards not only showed a preference for the modest responses but also justified this preference in terms of the negative impact of immodesty on social evaluation. In Expt 2, 60 children judged modest and immodest responses, and also completed two social cognition tasks tapping second-order mental-state reasoning. A teacherassessed measure of self-monitoring was also administered. As in the first experiment, children from age 8 viewed modest responses more positively than immodest responses. Furthermore, attitudes towards modesty were associated with individual differences in self-monitoring and social cognition, such that children with greater sensitivity to the interpersonal dynamics of social situations were more likely than others to rate modest responses positively. Implications for understanding children's social behaviour are discussed.}

We describe the process for developing the T-DASEF protocol and evaluating the reliability and predictive validity of components derived from the protocol in a diverse sample of 813 students (ages 8–12) and 33 teachers. We found that components from the T-DASEF protocol reliably capture teachers' EF-related difficulties and scaffolding practices. Multi-level path analysis revealed that the composite of teachers' displays of impulsivity, distraction, poor working memory or disorganization uniquely predicted direct assessment of students' fall EFs. Teachers' planning/organization scaffolding and cognitive flexibility scaffolding practices predicted spring students' EFs. This study highlights the feasibility and relevance of using an observational measure to understand how teachers' typically occurring EF-related behaviors and scaffolding practices relate to students' EF-skills in middle childhood.},

The present paper explores whether these two abnormalities might be related. We report four experiments that test whether normal children ‘read’ the eyes, particularly eye-direction, as conveying information about a person's mental states, and whether subjects with autism are specifically ‘blind’ to such information. The mental states assessed were desire, goal, refer, and think. The results confirm that normal children do use eye-direction as a cue for reading these mental states, as do subjects with mental handicap (including those with William's Syndrome). In contrast, subjects with autism failed to use eye-direction to infer the mental states. In addition, whilst normal children and children with mental handicap showed a preference for eye-direction over an unnatural cue when inferring these mental states, children with autism did not. These findings suggest that part of the explanation for the gaze abnormalities in autism may be a failure to comprehend that the eyes convey information about a person's mental states.}

  abstract = {This study examined the underlying processes and conditions that contribute to the school adjustment of shy children in Turkey, where children's interpersonal relationships in social settings and academic achievement are highly emphasized. First, we examined the unique mediating roles of children's feelings of social anxiety, depressive symptoms, and loneliness in the associations between shyness and indices of school outcomes (academic achievement and school liking/avoidance). Second, we explored the moderating role of children's peer acceptance in these associations. Fourth- and fifth-grade children (N = 599; Mage = 10.11 years, SD = 0.65; 48\% girls) provided information on shyness, social anxiety, depressive symptoms, loneliness, and school liking/avoidance. Head teachers in each classroom reported on students’ academic performance. The peer nomination method was used to assess children's peer relationships. Results revealed that when children displayed shy behaviours, they reported more depressive symptoms that were, in turn, associated with poorer academic performance, less school liking, and higher school avoidance. Moreover, shyness negatively predicted school liking at low levels of peer acceptance, suggesting that difficulties in peer relationships increased shy children's risk of school dissatisfaction. Overall, our findings support the importance of the interpersonal relationship context for children's adjustment within the Turkish cultural context. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Shy children have difficulties initiating and maintaining social interactions, which put them at risk for a wide range of socio-emotional difficulties. Shy children have poor academic performance and experience school adjustment difficulties in North America. What does this study add? Shyness is an important risk factor for poorer academic performance and adjustment among children in Turkey. The association between shyness and difficulties at school is explained by children's experience of depressive symptoms. Difficulties with peer relationships increase shy children's risk of school dissatisfaction.},

In four experiments (N =192), we compared 3- and 4-year-olds' performance on short and long causal chain questions, manipulating whether the child could draw on general knowledge to answer. We failed to replicate German and Nichols' result, finding instead that in two experiments (Experiments 1 and 3) there was no difference in performance on short and long causal chain questions and in two experiments (Experiments 2 and 4) children showed the opposite pattern: short causal chain questions were more difficult than long. These two unexpected patterns of results were replicated in a fifth study (N =97). Children with lower language ability found short causal chains more difficult than long. Performance by children with higher language ability was unaffected by the length of the causal chain they had to consider. We found no evidence that children showed precocious counterfactual thinking when asked about recent events in a causal chain and conclude that counterfactual thinking develops after 4 years of age.}

The objective of this longitudinal study was to examine the direct and indirect paths through which cSES influences late midlife cognitive outcomes.                                         Research Design and Methods               Participants were 1,009 male twins in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). At mean ages 20 and 62, participants completed a standardized test for general cognitive ability (GCA). The age 62 cognitive assessment also included in-person tests of processing speed, episodic memory, abstract reasoning, working memory, verbal fluency, visual-spatial ability, and executive functions. At mean age 56, participants were interviewed regarding their own and their parents’ education and occupation, and completed questionnaires about cognitive leisure activities and sociodemographic information. Multiple mediation analyses were conducted to examine the direct path effects and indirect path effects of cSES through age 20 GCA, adult SES, and cognitive leisure activities on seven cognitive outcomes at age 62, adjusting for age, ethnicity, and non-independence of observations.                                         Results               Total (direct plus indirect) effects were significant for all measures with the exception of executive functions. Men from lower cSES backgrounds had poorer cognitive functioning in late midlife. The direct effect of cSES was partially mediated for abstract reasoning, and was fully mediated for the remaining six cognitive outcomes. Total indirect effects accounted for at least half of the total effects in each model, with paths through age 20 GCA explaining most of the total indirect effects.                                         Discussion and Implications               cSES predicted cognitive functioning in late middle age Using multiple mediation models, we show that lower cSES predicts poorer cognition in late midlife primarily through young adult cognitive ability and to a lesser extent through SES in adulthood and engagement in cognitively stimulating activities.},

The results of the two experiments, with participants from children aged 6 to adults, revealed that word recall was better in Categorical sentences than in Descriptive sentences and are interpreted in terms of retrieval facilitation, due to pre-existing organization in semantic memory, at least from the age of 8 onwards. Recall performance was also better with sentences giving True statements than those giving False statements. Furthermore, Categorical False sentences are more effective in enhancing recall than Descriptive False sentences since they violate well-established semantic expectations. Such variables were also found to act among participants with a lower WM span, by this confirming that pre-existing organized information may compensate for less efficient WM.}

Results indicated that sleep problems were adversely affected (increased more/decreased less over time) when, in third grade, the father was absent, mothers were younger, experienced more negative emotions and were less sensitive in interacting with the child, and when the mother–child relationship was characterized by less closeness/more conflict. No linkages involving fathers and fathering were detected. Reciprocally, more sleep problems in the third grade predicted adverse changes in maternal negative emotionality, maternal sensitivity, and maternal closeness/conflict. Discussion highlights the need to conceptualize family functioning and children's sleep problems in family systems’ terms (i.e. reciprocal effects).}

  abstract = {In coincidence-timing studies, children have been shown to respond too early to slower stimuli and too late to faster stimuli. To examine this velocity effect, children aged 6, 7.5, 9, 10.5, and adults were tested with two different velocities in a prediction-motion task which consisted of judging, after the occlusion of the final part of its path, the moment of arrival of a moving stimulus towards a specified position. A similar velocity effect, resulting in later responses for the faster velocities than for the slower, was found primarily in the three younger groups of children (for the longer occlusion conditions: 600–1,320 milliseconds). However, this effect was not seen in all children in these groups. Individual analyses showed that this velocity effect, when present, is linked to the use of distance rather than time information, or to the confusion between these in extrapolating the occluded trajectories. The tendency to use one type of information or the other is a good predictor of accuracy and variability in this task and a good indicator of the development stage of the participants. Across development, children tend to initially use distance information with poor accuracy but relative consistency in responses. In a second stage, they use time and distance information alternatively across trials trying to find a better source of information with still poor accuracy and now great variability. In a final stage, they use time information to reach consistency and accuracy in their responses. This chronology follows the stages proposed by Savelesbergh and Van der Kamp (2000) explaining development with an initial stage of ‘freezing’ non-optimal relationships between information and movement, then a ‘freeing’ stage during which new solutions are searched for, and finally an ‘exploiting’ stage with an optimal relationship between information and movement.}

  abstract = {Development of dimensional vs. global modes of processing in haptics was examined in children (aged 5 and 9) and adults with stimuli varying along their texture density and hardness dimensions. In Expt 1 subjects were presented with a free classification task. Task 1 compared overall similarity classification (in which the grouped stimuli were similar on both dimensions) to part-identity classification (in which the grouped stimuli were identical on one dimension and very different on the other). Prominent part-identity responses were observed at age 9 but not at age 5 and in adults. Task 2 compared overall similarity to part-similarity classification (in which the grouped stimuli were similar on one dimension and very different on the other). Prominent overall similarity responses were observed in all age groups, demonstrating that subjects processed the stimuli across both dimensions. Experiment 2 (adapted from Garner, 1974) was based on a constrained speeded sorting task using control (unidimensional), correlated and orthogonal bidimensional conditions. It showed that, at age 5, selective attention to the isolated dimensions of the objects was difficult since response times (RT) were lower in the control than in the orthogonal conditions. These results were discussed in relation to the characteristics of haptic exploration and to the perceptual vs. decisional components involved in these classification tasks.}

  abstract = {To examine patterns of strategy choice and discovery during problem-solving of a novel locomotor task, 13.5- and 18-month-old infants were placed at the top of a staircase and encouraged to descend. Spontaneous stair descent strategy choices were documented step by step and trial by trial to provide a microgenetic account of problem-solving in action. Younger infants tended to begin each trial walking, were more likely to choose walking with each successive step, and were more likely to lose their balance and have to be rescued by an experimenter. Conversely, older infants tended to begin each trial scooting, were more likely to choose scooting with each successive step, and were more likely to use a handrail to augment balance on stairs. Documenting problem-solving microgenetically across age groups revealed striking similarities between younger infants' strategy development and older children's behaviour on more traditionally cognitive tasks, including using alternative strategies, mapping prior experiences with strategies to a novel task, and strengthening new strategies. As cognitive resources are taxed during a challenging task, resources available for weighing alternatives or inhibiting a well-used strategy are reduced. With increased motor experience, infants can more easily consider alternative strategies and maintain those solutions over the course of the trial.},

Sixty-two families were met on five occasions, allowing for assessment of maternal interactive behavior, paternal interactive behavior, and child attachment security between 1 and 2 years of age, and child EF at 2 and 3 years. The results suggested that composite scores of parental behavior and child attachment were related to child performance on EF tasks entailing strong working memory and cognitive flexibility components (conflict-EF). In particular, child attachment security was related to conflict-EF performance at 3 years above and beyond what was explained by a combination of all other social antecedents of child EF identified thus far: child verbal ability and prior EF, family SES, and parenting behavior. Attachment security may thus play a meaningful role in young children’s development of executive control.},

  abstract = {Given that depression is a debilitating disorder, it is critical that we advance our understanding about the aetiology of this disorder. This study investigated both traditional (temperament and parenting) and novel (emotion regulation strategy) risk factors associated with adolescent depression. Forty-four adolescents (12–16 years; 64\% females) with high scores on a self-report depressive symptomatology questionnaire were compared to a similar group of 44 adolescents with low scores, matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. Significant group differences were present on all assessed risk factors. The presence of high depressive symptomatology was found to be associated with (1) low levels of temperamentally based positive mood, flexibility, and approach behaviours, (2) a parenting style characterized by low nurturance and high overprotection, and (3) emotion regulation characterized by higher levels of expressive suppression and lower levels of cognitive reappraisal. It was concluded that, in addition to specific temperament characteristics and parenting style, use of particular emotion regulation strategies is associated with varying levels of depressive symptomatology. These findings reinforce the importance of incorporating emotion regulation into explanatory models of depression symptomatology. Further research that tests the direction of effects for these cross-sectional findings is warranted.}

Errors of commission (NoGo errors) were significantly correlated with symptom counts of hyperactivity-impulsivity, while errors of omission (Go errors) were significantly correlated with symptom counts for inattention in both caregiver and teacher reports. Cross-correlations were also evident, however, such that errors of commission were related to inattention symptoms, and errors of omission were related to hyperactivity-impulsivity. Moreover, hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention symptoms were highly intercorrelated in both caregiver (r=.52) and teacher reports (r=.70), while errors of commission and omission were virtually uncorrelated in the Go/NoGo task (r=.06). The results highlight the difficulty in disentangling hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention in questionnaires, and suggest that these constructs may be more clearly distinguished in laboratory measures such as the Go/NoGo task.}

We investigated pragmatic aspects of communication and language comprehension in relation to poor attention and/or high hyperactivity in a nondiagnosed population of 7- to 11-year olds. Classroom teachers rated their pupils' attention and hyperactivity/impulsivity on the ADD-H Comprehensive Teacher Rating scale (ACTeRS). Three groups were formed: children with poor attention and low hyperactivity (poor attention group), children with good attention and high hyperactivity (high hyperactivity group), and children with both poor attention and high hyperactivity (poor attention/high hyperactivity group). Their performance was compared with that of same-age controls in two studies: Study 1 (N = 94) investigated the comprehension of figurative language in and out of context and Study 2 (N = 100) investigated the pragmatic aspects of communication using the Children's Communication Checklist – Second Edition. Two groups, the poor attention and the poor attention/high hyperactivity groups, were impaired in both their comprehension of figurative language and their communication skills. The high hyperactivity group was impaired in their comprehension of figurative language but they did not exhibit communication impairments. The findings extend work with clinical populations of children with ADHD: even in a nondiagnosed sample of children, poor attention and elevated levels of hyperactivity are associated with pragmatic language weaknesses.}

Three tasks from Peterson and Siegal (1997) (false belief (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, \& Frith, 1985), false photo (Zaitchik, 1990) and innate potential (Gelman \& Wellman, 1991)) were employed. A further three tasks (perception (Slaughter \& Gopnik, 1996), balance (Siegler, 1976) and illness (Kalish, 1998)) were included to gain insight into the similarities and differences in understanding across groups of children and within each domain. Preschoolers performed well on both the intuitive psychology tasks, children with autism performed poorly on these tasks, and children with DS performed well on the perception task but poorly on the false belief task. By contrast, performance on the physics and biology tasks was not significantly different across groups. These findings support the argument that cognitive development is domain-specific and highlight the need for further research in this area.}

  abstract = {Recent concern in the developmental psychology literature with peer facilitation of children's learning is matched by a corresponding concern in the cognitive science literature with user-user interactions in the context of computer use. A study is reported in which 11-year-old children (N = 39) worked over three successive sessions on a problem-solving task making heavy demands on planning and information handling, implemented in HyperCard. Children worked on the computer either in pairs or individually on the first two sessions, and all worked individually on the third. By the second session, the performance of the pairs was significantly superior to that of the individuals. On the final session, with a slightly modified task, those who had previously worked in pairs showed a substantial advantage. Possible explanations for these results are discussed.}

  abstract = {This study investigated the development of the many-to-one counting strategy in 4- year-old children. In the first experiment, 52 children participated. Their development with respect to two kinds of tasks, a hidden-items task and a needed-items task, was studied over four sessions. Children (n = 28) who accurately used the many-to-one strategy in Session 4 also participated in the second experiment. These children were presented with more difficult hidden- and needed-items tasks. It was found that children often produced the strategy for the first time on tasks with relatively few items. Most children then kept producing it, even if they initially did not obtain much profit from its use because of counting errors. Increasing task difficulty resulted in children making more counting errors or reverting to invalid strategies depending on the nature of the new task.}

  abstract = {Pictures are named more slowly in the context of semantically related pictures than in the context of unrelated pictures. This semantic blocking effect has been studied extensively in adult participants, and one study has revealed its presence in 6-year-old children. However, little is known about the development of the effect with age. In this study, a blocked cyclic naming procedure was arranged for 5- to 7-year-old and 10- to 12-year-old children. The semantic blocking effect obtained did not differ in size between the two age groups. This finding is tentatively interpreted as evidence that the semantic blocking effect does not have the same underlying cause as interference effects typically observed in naming tasks involving a distractor stimulus, like the Stroop task. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The semantic blocking effect has been demonstrated in adults, but little is known about its development in childhood. Age-related changes in performance in children have been used to distinguish various types of inhibitory control. What does this study add? A semantic blocking effect was obtained in 5- to 7-year-old children and – for the first time – in 10- to 12-year-old children. In the two age groups, the effect was equal in size and did not show up in the first cycles of the experiment. The findings are argued to be in line with the distinction unintentional vs. intentional inhibitory control.},

  abstract = {Magical thinking in childhood bears at least superficial similarities to obsessive compulsion, and recent cognitive models of obsessive compulsive disorder implicate forms of thinking akin to the magical. However, there has been little research on the relations between normal magical thinking in childhood and obsessive compulsion. The present study has two aims: to investigate magical thinking in young children and through to late adolescence, and to examine the relation between magical thinking and obsessive compulsion. It was found that children across the age range studied reported some magical thinking, and there was no general decline in the level of magical thinking with age. This overall pattern was complicated, however, by fluctuations in the level of magical thinking in later childhood and early adolescence, and by gender differences. There was a significant correlation between levels of magical thinking and obsessive compulsion. The results are discussed in the light of current theories.}

  abstract = {Cohesion and distancing are both relevant characteristics of interpersonal relationships; the first pertains to the constitution and strengthening of the relationship, the second to the assertion of individual autonomy. This study explores the use of indices of cohesion and distancing in drawings made by boys and girls 6- to 11-year- old showing themselves with a friend. The main hypothesis is that children at each age level would introduce in their drawings pictorial indices of cohesion, as these are necessary and sufficient to show that a relationship exists; distancing indices would be added as options. Drawings were scored on two scales, each composed of six subscales, measuring either cohesive elements or distancing elements. Separate variance analyses for cohesion and distancing (ages x sex x scores in the subscales) yielded main effects of the different subscales and of sex (boys obtained higher distancing scores than girls). Two factors, pertaining to spatial organization and figure interaction, emerge both for cohesion and distancing in two separate factor analyses. Another variance analysis (age x sex x total cohesion and distancing scores) confirmed the hypothesized prevalence of cohesion over distancing. Finally, cross-tabulation of cohesion and distancing scores allowed detection of various combinations of cohesive and distancing elements in the pictorial representation of friendship. As expected, no age-linked effect emerged in the above-mentioned analyses.}

  abstract = {Research studies have implicated executive functions in reading difficulties (RD). But while some studies have found children with RD to be impaired on tasks of executive function other studies report unimpaired performance. A meta-analysis was carried out to determine whether these discrepant findings can be accounted for by differences in the tasks of executive function that are utilized. A total of 48 studies comparing the performance on tasks of executive function of children with RD with their typically developing peers were included in the meta-analysis, yielding 180 effect sizes. An overall effect size of 0.57 (SE .03) was obtained, indicating that children with RD have impairments on tasks of executive function. However, effect sizes varied considerably suggesting that the impairment is not uniform. Moderator analysis revealed that task modality and IQ-achievement discrepancy definitions of RD influenced the magnitude of effect; however, the age and gender of participants and the nature of the RD did not have an influence. While the children's RD were associated with executive function impairments, variation in effect size is a product of the assessment task employed, underlying task demands, and definitional criteria.}

Mothers of approximately 10,000 children participating in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children rated child temperament. Stability coefficients for child temperament scales were medium to large, and stability was generally robust across moderators except child gender and birth order and mother age and education, which had small moderating effects on reports of stability of child temperament. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Some is known about the stability of temperament in infancy in small samples, but much less is known about the stability of temperament in early childhood or its moderation. What does this study add? This study uses a large sample (˜10,000) to trace the stability of temperament from 3 to 6 years in three waves and considers child age, gender, birth order, and term status as well as mother age, education, anxiety, and depression as moderators of stability.},

However, less is known about whether these difficulties continue into adulthood for this group, or about the potential role of environmental resources (e.g., social support) or internal resources (e.g., self-efficacy). This study investigates emotional health in 81 adults with a history of developmental LI (aged 24) compared with 87 age-matched peers (AMPs) using Beck Inventories. Social support and self-efficacy measures were examined as predictors. The results were fourfold: (1) adults with LI had higher levels of emotional health problems; (2) whilst the availability of social support was similar across groups, people with LI received more help from others compared to peers; (3) social support was not significantly related to emotional health in those with LI – in contrast, for AMPs, uptake of support indicated poorer emotional health; (4) self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of emotional health in both groups and fully mediated the relationship between language and emotional health (no moderation by group). This cross-sectional study has implications for concurrent factors that might affect emotional health outcomes for children and young people with and without LI.},

  abstract = {This study reports three experiments investigating children's understanding of the distinction between pretence and reality. Previous research (e.g. Harris, Brown, Marriott, Whittall, \& Harmer, 1991; Johnson \& Harris, 1994) has suggested marked individual differences in children's susceptibility to pretend-reality confusions. The present series of experiments explored the effects of cognitive availability and affect on pretence understanding. In Expts 1 and 2, 5-6-year-old children were asked to pretend that liked, disliked and neutral entities were inside either opaque (high availability) or transparent (low availability) boxes. The children's responses when asked to select or reject the boxes was determined by the affect evoked by the entity. In Expt 3, children were asked to explain their behaviour towards the pretended entities. The results indicated individual differences between groups of children. Across all three studies the evidence suggests that some children as old as 6 years of age may experience temporary pretend-reality confusions which can be explained in terms of the effects of availability.}

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that infants' observation of others' reaching actions activates corresponding motor representations which develop with their motor experience. Contralateral reaching develops a few months later than ipsilateral reaching, and 9-month-old infants are less likely to map the observation of these reaches to their motor representations. The goal of the current study was to test whether a brief familiarization with contralateral reaching is sufficient to prime this less developed motor representation to increase the likelihood of its activation. In Experiment 1, infants were familiarized with contralateral reaching before they were tested in an observational version of the A-not-B paradigm. A significant number of infants searched incorrectly, suggesting that the observation of contralateral reaching primed their motor representations. In Experiment 2, infants were familiarized with ipsilateral reaching, which shared the goals but not the movements associated with the contralateral reaches observed during testing, and they did not show a search bias. Taken together, these results suggest that a brief familiarization with a movement-specific behaviour facilitates the direct matching of observed and executed actions.},

Living in conditions of high resources increases the likelihood that children will do well and be able to address whatever challenges they face; and it often leads to a very productive and satisfying life. By contrast, living in a resource‐poor environment makes it difficult for children to avoid having problems, be they poor health, poor achievement, or engagement in maladaptive behavior. There are many mechanisms linking low socioeconomic status to suboptimal functioning, from epigenetic changes that begin during pregnancy to insufficient nutrition and health care, to shortcomings in access to materials needed for learning, to living in chaos for extended periods of childhood, with parents struggling to fill gaps and to provide supportive care. Research is only beginning to delineate the complex interconnections between socioeconomic factors and the processes that connect them to various components of children's development.},

  abstract = {The essentials of a theory of mind are generally considered to be acquired around 4 years of age when the child succeeds in the standard ‘Maxi task’ (Wimmer \& Perner, 1983). However, rational thought is not attained before 7-8 years of age in other domains of cognitive development. This study demonstrates that the mastery of mental state attribution using logical criteria is not reached before age 7-8 years when several assessments of a belief need to be coordinated. This is revealed by the dissociation between the cognitive and emotional assessments of a false belief which yield contradictory responses in most of the children who succeed on the standard task. The results were replicated in five experiments with a total of 254 children aged 3-8 years. The analysis of this decalage focuses on the autonomy of emotional attributions and the semi-mental and semi-behavioural structure of belief understanding implied in the standard task. An increase in processing capacity leads to a rational concept of belief around 7-8 years: this concept is called here ‘third-person', in opposition to ‘second-person’ which involves only an initial differentiation from the first-person point of view. Second-person depends on an opposition between the self and the other in terms of a single, modular evaluation of belief, whereas third-person depends on an integration among various assessments and provides a consistent and isotropic concept of belief.}

Recent studies have begun to investigate these impairments empirically, acknowledging the need for an approach that considers cross-syndrome comparisons and developmental changes across the different component functions of attention. The present study assessed children with WS and DS using a new preschool attention battery (ECAB: early childhood attention battery), designed to be suitable for mental age 3–6 years including groups with developmental disorders. The ECAB has the advantage of giving an individual profile of attentional abilities for each child, covering different components of attention. In relation to test norms for their mental age, both groups showed a profile of strengths and weaknesses in the attention domain. Both syndrome groups performed relatively well on tests of sustained attention and poorly on aspects of selective attention and attentional control (executive function). The DS group showed a specific strength in auditory sustained attention, whilst the WS group showed a particular deficit in visuo-spatial response control. There was also evidence for considerable differences in the developmental trajectory of these abilities across the two groups. The results provide evidence for syndrome-specific patterns of impairment, and distinct profiles of strengths and weaknesses that may be useful in understanding the nature of everyday attention difficulties in these groups and tailoring interventions to meet these needs.}

In the light of adult and child studies supporting a model of distinct networks for specific attentional operations, tests in the current battery were selected with the aim of measuring functions of selective attention, sustained attention and attentional control (executive function). Normative data were collected from 154 typically developing children aged 3–6 years and examined using exploratory factor analysis to determine latent constructs underlying test performance. This analysis suggested increasing differentiation of attention functions over the age range, with support for the hypothesized three-factor model only after 4½ years of age. Additional analyses supported the validity of the new attention battery with respect to (1) parent/teacher report measures of everyday attention behaviour and (2) later performance on the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch), a battery designed for children aged 6–16 years. The results show the developing differentiation of attention functions and support the ecological and predictive validity of the battery as providing early performance-based measures of attention and an attention ‘profile’ for each individual child, which may aid characterization and remediation of neurodevelopmental disorders.}

  abstract = {Cette thèse a pour objectif général d’examiner les liens réciproques entre la qualité du soutien émotionnel en classe d’éducation préscolaire cinq ans et celle reliée à l’engagement de l’enfant envers son enseignant(e) et ses pairs. Pour se faire, 113enfants (66 filles et 47 garçons) âgés de cinq à six ans (M = 73,34 mois, ÉT = 4,22)ont été recrutés. Ils proviennent de 12 classes d’éducation préscolaire cinq ans dans lesquelles on retrouve, en moyenne, 17 enfants. L’échantillon se compose également de 12 enseignantes à l’éducation préscolaire cinq ans qui sont en moyenne âgées de 35,92 ans (ÉT = 8,53). Les classes sont réparties dans sept écoles de la région de Québec et dans une école de la Beauce. La thèse se compose de deux articles, qui correspondent à cinq objectifs spécifiques de recherche. Le premier objectif vise à examiner la qualité du soutien émotionnel en classe, tandis que le deuxième consiste à mesurer les niveaux d’engagement (positif et négatif) de l’enfant envers son enseignante et ses pairs en classe d’éducation préscolaire cinq ans. Le troisième objectif est d’étudier les associations réciproques entre la qualité du soutien émotionnel et l’engagement de l’enfant envers son enseignante et ses pairs. Ces trois premiers objectifs sont abordés dans le premier article de cette thèse. Les résultats de ce premier article indiquent que la qualité du soutien émotionnel est de niveau modéré, l’engagement positif de l’enfant envers l’enseignante et son engagement négatif sont de niveaux faibles, alors que l’engagement positif envers les pairs est de niveau moyen-faible. L’étude des liens réciproques entre ces variables montre que la qualité du soutien émotionnel prédit l’engagement positif de l’enfant envers ses pairs ainsi que son engagement négatif envers son enseignante et ses pairs en classe. Par ailleurs, l’engagement de l’enfant dans ses interactions envers son enseignante et ses pairs ne prédit pas la qualité du soutien émotionnel. Ces premiers résultats soulignent la nécessité de poursuivre l’étude des facteurs favorisant le développement de la qualité du soutien émotionnel en classe, par exemple en bonifiant la formation initiale des enseignant(e)s à ce sujet. En ce qui concerne les faibles niveaux d’engagement observés, il est proposé d’approfondir nos connaissances des facteurs contribuant à la qualité de celui-ci. Les deux derniers objectifs de cette thèse, abordés dans le deuxième article, visent d’abord à étudier les différents contextes de classe, selon les types d’activités (routines/transitions, jeux libres/ateliers) et de regroupements (grand groupe, petits groupes, individuel), pour ensuite déterminer si les niveaux d’engagement varient selon ces mêmes contextes. Les analyses présentées dans ce deuxième article indiquent que les contextes qui ont principalement été observés dans les classes sont des activités de routines/transitions et le regroupement en grand groupe. De plus, l’engagement de l’enfant envers les pairs est plus élevé lors d’activités de jeux libres et d’ateliers et de regroupements en petits groupes, alors que l’engagement de l’enfant envers l’enseignante est plus élevé lors d’activités de routines et transitions. La faible proportion des jeux libres/ateliers et du regroupement en petits groupes observée est évoquée comme piste d’intérêt afin de sensibiliser les enseignant(e)s à leur apport dans les niveaux d’engagement des enfants envers leurs pairs. La nécessité de préciser nos connaissances quant aux contextes prévalents en classe d’éducation préscolaire cinq ans au Québec est enfin soulignée. La conclusion permet de dégager des avenues de recherches prometteuses ainsi que des pistes reliées à la pratique enseignante à l’éducation préscolaire cinq ans.},

  abstract = {Delay of gratification, an aspect of self-regulation, describes the ability to inhibit impulsive behavior and shift attention from temptation towards goal-directed behavior. The ability to delay gratification is a highly valued skill in the early years of school. Using a Child × Environment model, this study of 176 first graders investigates the combined contribution of children's ability to delay gratification and amount of exposure to three common instructional contexts across the school year in predicting children's academic achievement and learningrelated classroom behavior. Two interesting patterns emerged. First, more time spent in non-instruction led to less fall-to-spring improvement in math and poorer ratings of learning-related behavior the lower a child's ability to delay gratification. Second, more time spent in teacher-managed instruction attenuated the association between low delay of gratification and poor school outcomes (i.e., math achievement, learning-related behaviors). Findings are discussed in terms of the varying amount of self-regulatory burden placed on children dependent upon instructional context.},

  abstract = {The content of mothers' talk to their infants (informative/eliciting acts versus non-informative/non-eliciting acts) was examined in terms of whether utterances were timed to follow their infants' ‘talk’ after a brief silence interval (alternating mode of temporal patterning), or to overlap their infants' ‘talk’ (covocalizing mode of temporal patterning). A total of 2827 maternal utterances in 39 mother-infant dyads were collected at three-month intervals over infant ages 3 to 24 months. The results indicated that mothers consistently timed informative/eliciting acts in ways that resemble conversations between adult partners (i.e. informative/eliciting acts predominated in the alternating mode), and that the relative proportions of these acts increased significantly during the infants' first year. Corresponding decreases in the relative proportions of non-informative/non-eliciting acts occurred in conjunction with significant reductions in the use of covocalizing mode, and this trend continued in the infants' second year: whereas at 3 and 6 months non-informative/ non-eliciting acts were predominant in the covocalizing mode, at 15 and 18 months they were predominant in the alternating mode. It is argued that such changes in content and timing constitute stylistic adjustments in mothers' management of interactions at the local moment-to-moment level, and occur within the context of global transformations in the dynamics of such interactions as infants' communicative abilities develop.}

  abstract = {Preschoolers' understanding of causal rules was examined using a marble and ramp apparatus operating in two distinct configurations. Experiment 1, conducted with 32 3-year-olds and 16 4-year-olds, examined whether children could predict where a marble would emerge when given verbal rules indicating the marble's trajectory. Over two sessions, 4-year-olds made correct predictions, irrespective of the apparatus's configuration. Three-year-olds, in contrast, were unable to alternate between rule sets and performed poorly when the marble rolled diagonally across the apparatus. In two additional experiments, with the ramp uncovered to reveal mechanical shunts and feedback given on each trial, the verbal rules were presented with (Experiment 2) or without pointing gestures (Experiment 3). Generalization was tested using the original protocol of Experiment 1. Older 3-year-olds in both experiments benefited from training, and most continued to perform well when gestures, feedback, and visual access to the mechanism were eliminated. Of the younger 3-year-olds, only those exposed to rules with gestures showed any improvement, and the improvement did not generalize. The results indicate that providing redundant non-verbal cues may facilitate preschoolers' use of complex rule systems, with poor generalization attributable to young children's dependence on cues to access the relevant rules.}

  abstract = {Children can selectively attend to various attributes of a model, such as past accuracy or physical strength, to guide their social learning. There is a debate regarding whether a relation exists between theory-of-mind skills and selective learning. We hypothesized that high performance on theory-of-mind tasks would predict preference for learning new words from accurate informants (an epistemic attribute), but not from physically strong informants (a non-epistemic attribute). Three- and 4-year-olds (N = 65) completed two selective learning tasks, and their theory-of-mind abilities were assessed. As expected, performance on a theory-of-mind battery predicted children's preference to learn from more accurate informants but not from physically stronger informants. Results thus suggest that preschoolers with more advanced theory of mind have a better understanding of knowledge and apply that understanding to guide their selection of informants. This work has important implications for research on children's developing social cognition and early learning.},

Six second-born children were observed with their mothers and older siblings at two-month intervals from 24 to 36 months. In addition to increases in the frequency with which children referred to internal states, developmental changes were noted in the content and context of their talk. These included: more frequent references to others' inner states, increased use of inner state turns in reflective discussions and in efforts to manipulate the feelings and behaviour of others, and more frequent references to the causes and consequences of inner states. Parallel changes were noted in mothers' conversations about inner states; maternal references to the thoughts, feelings and desires of those other than the child increased, and their use of these terms in behaviour-controlling contexts decreased. Results highlight the role of social interaction in children's developing understanding of inner states.}

In each of 20 trials, participants watched a model grasp two objects simultaneously and move them together. On every trial, the model directed her gaze towards only one of the objects. Some object pairs were related and had a clear functional relationship (e.g., flower, vase), while others were functionally unrelated (e.g., cardboard square, ladybug). Owing to attentional effects of eye gaze, it was expected that all participants would more faithfully imitate the grasp on the gazed-at object than the object not gazed-at. Children were expected to imitate less faithfully on trials with functionally related objects than those without, due to goal-hierarchy effects. Results support effects of eye gaze on imitation of grasping. Children's grasping accuracy on functionally related and functionally unrelated trials was similar, but they were more likely to only use one hand on trials where the object pairs were functionally related than unrelated. Implications for theories of imitation are discussed.}

In a combined diary-survey study among 234 parents of 4- to 12-year-old children, I investigated how different styles of advertising mediation (active vs. restrictive) and consumer communication (concept-oriented vs. socio-oriented) moderated the relation between children's advertising exposure and their consumption of advertised energy-dense food products. Interaction analysis in regression showed that active advertising mediation (i.e. explaining the purpose and nature of advertising), and socio-oriented consumer communication (i.e. emphasizing control and restrictions) significantly reduced the impact of advertising on children's food consumption. Parental restrictions of advertising exposure were only effective among younger children ({$<$}8). These results suggest that critical discussion about advertising and rule making about consumption are most effective in countering the impact of food advertising.}

This study examined whether there are differences in acuity of the approximate number system (ANS) between CHL and CNH, and whether ANS acuity is related to math achievement. Working memory (WM), short-term memory (STM), and inhibition were considered as mediators of any relationship between ANS acuity and math achievement. Seventy-five CHL were compared with 75 age- and gender-matched CNH. ANS acuity, mathematical reasoning, WM, and STM of CHL were significantly poorer compared to CNH. Group differences in math ability were no longer significant when ANS acuity, WM, or STM was controlled. For CNH, WM and STM fully mediated the relationship of ANS acuity to math ability; for CHL, WM and STM only partially mediated this relationship. ANS acuity, WM, and STM are significant contributors to hearing status differences in math achievement, and to individual differences within the group of CHL. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Children with hearing loss often perform poorly on measures of math achievement, although there have been few studies focusing on basic numerical cognition in these children. In typically developing children, the approximate number system predicts math skills concurrently and longitudinally, although there have been some contradictory findings. Recent studies suggest that domain-general skills, such as inhibition, may account for the relationship found between the approximate number system and math achievement. What does this study adds? This is the first robust examination of the approximate number system in children with hearing loss, and the findings suggest poorer acuity of the approximate number system in these children compared to hearing children. The study addresses recent issues regarding the contradictory findings of the relationship of the approximate number system to math ability by examining how this relationship varies across children with normal hearing and hearing loss, and by examining whether this relationship is mediated by domain-general skills (working memory, short-term memory, and inhibition).},

Results showed a significant four-way concordance between age-6 attachment behaviour and age-8 doll play classifications. Each of the four attachment classifications was concordant in the absence of major negative life-events, but only the disorganized classifications remained concordant when at least one negative life-event occurred between the two assessment times. Children with a disorganized attachment classification or representation had higher externalizing scores than secure and avoidant children at both timepoints. Finally, the avoidant and disorganized behavioural classifications predicted avoidant and disorganized representations, respectively, even when controlling for age-6 teacher reports of social adaptation.}

  abstract = {Previous research has yielded conflicting findings about the existence and the direction of the size changes which occur in children's drawings when they are asked to draw topics which have been given an affective characterization. The present study was designed to investigate whether children scale up the size of drawings of topics which have been given a positive characterization, and scale down the size of drawings of topics which have been given a negative characterization. The participants were 258 children aged between 4 and 11 years who completed three drawings of either a man, a dog or a tree. Each child drew a baseline drawing of a neutrally characterized figure, and two further drawings of a positively and a negatively characterized version of the same figure. It was found that the children drew the positively characterized topics larger than the neutrally characterized topics, and reduced the size of the negatively characterized topics relative to the baseline drawings. These patterns occurred at all ages and with all three drawing topics. Two possible explanations of the findings are discussed: the operation of an appetitive-defensive mechanism in children, and the acquisition of pictorial conventions.}

  abstract = {In recent years, an impressive volume of evidence has accumulated demonstrating that youth involvement in structured, organized activities (e.g. school sports, community clubs) may facilitate positive youth development. We present a theory-based framework for studying structured activity involvement (SAI) as a context for positive youth development based on two key dimensions: breadth and intensity of involvement. Our main goal is to demonstrate the separability, salience, and developmental significance of these two dimensions. We review three developmental theoretical approaches (identity development, life-span selection–optimization–compensation theory, and affordances) that support our conceptualization of breadth and intensity as salient and significant dimensions of SAI. We also summarize our recent program of research on SAI demonstrating the separability of breadth and intensity dimensions, which shows links between these dimensions and indicators of positive development. Finally, we discuss how the proposed breadth-intensity approach could be used to extend research on the linkage between youth SAI and successful development.}

  abstract = {One of the most prominent tasks to measure spatial-conflict inhibitory control in preschoolers is the windows task (Russell et al., 1991, Br. J. Dev. Psychol., 9, 331). However, this task has been criticized given its high demands on abilities other than inhibition. The aim of the current set of studies was to establish the ‘car task’ as a novel instrument to assess conflict inhibition in children. In this task, children are asked to point at the current location of an occluded object. To do so, they have to inhibit a misleading colour cue in front of the locations in critical trials. In Study 1, we demonstrated that 3- to 6-year-old children's (N = 88) performance in the car task correlated positively with that in the windows task (even after controlling for age). Study 2 investigated whether children's failure in the car task might be caused by their inability to master the basic processes involved in the task rather than a lack of inhibition. We presented a new group of preschoolers (N = 85) with a modified version of the task without any misleading colour cues. Performance significantly improved, indicating that the difficulty of the car task lies in the necessity to inhibit the misleading colour cue leading towards the incorrect location. These findings suggest that the car task is a valid measurement of spatial-conflict inhibition in children. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Inhibitory control (IC) is important for action planning and execution. One of the most prominent measurements of spatial-conflict IC is the windows task. This task has been criticized for additionally requiring rule inference to succeed. What does this study adds? Performance in the novel car task correlates with that in the windows task. Study 2 controls for demands other than IC such as memory or task difficulty. This task can thus be used to measure IC more purely without demanding rule inference.},

In our study the objects to be grasped were spheres and cubes carefully graded to allow comparisons of grips with object shape and size controlled. The trend noted by Halverson, for power grips to decrease and precision grips to increase, was replicated so that by the second year precision grasping is the dominant mode of prehension. However, the transition to precision grasping appears to occur by selection from a developmentally prior mixture of power and precision grips. In comparing spheres and cubes object size was the most important factor influencing grip selection but object shape also had a lesser influence. Object size may have acted as a scaling factor for grip selection. The findings are discussed in relation to a selectionist approach to the development of prehension.}

The mouth is open in ‘anticipation’ of arrival of the hand and the movement does not require visual guidance.

  abstract = {To examine the culturally embedded nature of religious practices, we conducted a mixed-methods study in which Muslim American adolescents described how and why their religious practices had changed in recent years (see Etengoff \& Daiute, 2013, J. Adolesc. Res., 28, 690). Participants included 201 Muslim adolescents (ages 13–19) from predominantly immigrant families; all were contestants in a Muslim Inter-Scholastic Tournament regional competition. Participants completed surveys including an item regarding whether their religious practices had changed, and for those who answered affirmatively, open-ended questions about the change. Additional measures assessed ethnic identity and perceived discrimination. As hypothesized, the 60\% of participants who reported a change in religious practices described this shift as a response to new contexts, people, and religious knowledge. Those who reported a change also reported higher levels of ethnic identity exploration and perceived discrimination. Overall, Muslim American adolescents’ descriptions portrayed religious practices as developing through reciprocal interactions with culture. More generally, participants’ descriptions point to the viability of a model in which religious practices change and in turn are changed by cultural contexts. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Religious development is viewed as taking place in relational systems with reciprocity between individuals and surrounding contexts. Variations in contexts predict variations in religious development, but mechanisms of development are not well understood. Muslim Americans, including adolescents, show high levels of religious involvement and experience unique cultural and religious contexts. Muslim American emerging adults describe their religious practices as responsive to sociocultural contexts. What does the study add? This study focuses on Muslim American adolescents, a group that has received little research attention, especially in regard to religious development. Participants reported a wide array of changes in religious practices, and they described these changes as responses to social and cultural influences. Participants’ descriptions of changing practices can be understood through a Vygotskian framework in which religious practices are cultural tools that both respond to and shape surrounding cultural contexts.},

An interview revealed that less skilled comprehenders differed from same-age skilled comprehenders in their knowledge about reading and reading strategies, but they did not differ significantly from a younger group of children of equivalent comprehension ability. In contrast, a reading task demonstrated that less skilled comprehenders were poorer than both control groups at adapting their reading style to achieve different goals. These data demonstrate that there are direct relations between comprehension skill and both knowledge about reading and reading strategies, when individual differences in word reading skill have been controlled for. Furthermore, the results of the second study rule out the possibility that the differences found between groups in their ability to set and reach suitable reading targets were simply a by-product of reading comprehension level.

  abstract = {Callear, Harvey, and Bimler (2016, International Journal of Behavioral Development, 41, 456) organized children's emotion regulation behaviours into a coherent structure. However, further investigation is needed to identify core patterns of these emotion regulation behaviours. To identify clusters and prototypal constellations of emotion regulation behaviours, the 85 behavioural items comprising the Children's Emotion Regulation Inventory (ChERI) were ranked by 151 parents in order of applicability, using an ordinal sorting procedure (Method of Successive Sorts). Responses were aggregated in empirical scales, for classification of the cases using hierarchical and k-means clustering. The scales were based on nine key ‘hotspots’ of children's emotion regulation behaviours, interpreted as Outward Engagement, Inward or Somatic Focus, Disengagement, Disruptive, Impulsive/Labile, Social Connectedness/Compliance, Generating Closeness/Intimacy, Establishing Order and Generating Disorder. Five summary styles of children's emotion regulation emerged and are characterized on those scales. These hotspots and styles provide guidance to clinicians, parents, teachers, and other invested adults to assess and support children's emotional development. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Measurements of children's emotion regulation predominantly focus on internal processes and/or isolated expressions of emotion regulation behaviours. Research detailing anger and anxiety emotion regulation styles exists (e.g., Carthy, Horesh, Apter, \& Gross, 2010, Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 32, 23; Zalewski, Lengua, Wilson, Trancik, \& Bazinet, 2011, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 110, 141). Callear, Harvey, and Bimler (2016, International Journal of Behavioral Development, 41, 456) developed the Children's Emotion Regulation Inventory to identify children's observable emotion regulation strategies. What does this study add? Research does not investigate which clusters of children's emotion regulation behaviours are most commonly exhibited and nor does it investigate emotion regulation behavioural styles. Examines how children's emotion regulation behaviours co-occur. Identifies nine core clusters (groupings) of emotion regulation behaviours most commonly observed to be exhibited in children. Identifies five emotion regulation behavioural styles (common co-occurring patterns of emotion regulation behaviour clusters) in children.},

Empathy in typically developing children is mediated by executive functions. Executive functioning is also impaired in preterm children. Of particular interest in this study are the attentional components of executive functioning as mediators of empathic development. Thirty-two 7-year-old EP children and 40 age-matched term children participated in the Project K.I.D.S program and completed the Kids Empathy Development Scale (KEDS), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), and Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch). Children born extremely preterm exhibited poorer performance on all measures. The mediating role of attention in empathy competence was not supported by mediation modelling when FSIQ was controlled. As predicted, the EP group showed weaker empathic development relative to typically developing children. They also showed poorer attentional abilities. However, the effect of preterm birth on empathy was not mediated by executive-level attention. The cognitive mechanisms underpinning poor empathy competence in EP children remain unclear. Future research needs to examine the role of inhibition, social–emotional recognition, and regulation.},

Children ages 3–6 enrolled in preschool, kindergarten, or Head Start programs were rated concurrently by respondents on English and Spanish versions of the PKBS. Results showed virtually identical internal consistency of scores on both forms on Social Skills (.93) and Problem Behavior (.96) Scales. Correlations between forms for Social Skills and Problem Behavior scores were .93 and .94, respectively.

  abstract = {Changing the way in which children respond significantly improves performance across a variety of cognitive domains. However, the basis for this response-mode effect is unknown. To address this issue, the current study tested 78 preschool children on a measure of executive functioning (the windows task: Hala \& Russell, ). The task requires children to point to an empty box to receive a box with a treat in it. There were four versions of the task, differing only in the way in which children made their responses. Children in the baseline condition, who pointed with their finger, performed poorly. However, children in three alternative response-mode conditions won the treat significantly more often. Strikingly, even children who pretended to be pointing with an arrow – but were in reality pointing with their finger – performed significantly better than baseline. We suggest that non-standard response modes encourage children to reflect on their actions and that this reduces the number of unreflective errors they make. The findings demonstrate that response-mode effects do not depend on the presence of a physical means of responding (such as an arrow), but can be achieved via a purely cognitive means (such as engaging in pretence).},

Vygotsky's developmental framework has provoked interest in the ontogenesis of self-regulatory abilities in children through an analysis of social problem solving. Both seek to explain cognitive development through social processes. Theoretical and empirical links between the two approaches are explored, and the possible role of linguistic processes as causal mechanisms examined.}

  abstract = {A novel paradigm investigates the ability to understand an agent's intended goal in children with autism (N = 25), typically developing children (N = 46), and adults (N = 16+12) by watching a non-human agent's kinematic properties alone. Computer animations depict a circle at the bottom of a U-shaped valley rolling up and down its slopes and getting closer to a target resting at the top of either side of the valley. The circle's persistent motion and improving attempts evoke the attribution of the intention to reach the target, regardless of whether the circle fails or attains its goal. Children with autism are as able as controls to infer an agent's intended-goal, disregarding its failure to reach the target. In addition, the study showed that the perception of persistent motion is a sufficient but not a necessary cue for very young children and children with autisn to attribute intention to an agent, whereas adults consider the persistent motion cue as a sufficient and necessary cue to attribute intention to an agent.}

  abstract = {The present research examines the ability of 6th- and 7th-grade poor and good comprehenders to monitor their comprehension during reading and also examines their consequent activation of strategies. In particular, we considered the process of search through the text, that is moving up and down the text in order to find relevant information to respond to subsequent questions. In order to study this process, good and poor comprehenders were invited to read a descriptive passage and to respond to questions, some of which were embedded in the text and some of which were at the end of the text. Half of the participants in each group were also required to give a confidence rating of their response accuracy. Both groups benefited from the embedded questions, thus revealing that a specific search process affects the difficulty in responding to questions. Further, poor comprehenders were able to monitor their accuracy (i.e. know how well they understand). Finally the monitoring requirement did not have a positive influence on comprehension. A second experiment tested whether the poorer performance of poor comprehenders for the questions at the end of the text was due to an inability to search through the text in order to find the required information or to a deficit in strategy utilization. When explicitly invited to search through the text, poor comprehenders were able to search and improve their performance, suggesting that their failure with the final questions in Expt 1 was at least partially due to a deficit in strategy utilization.}

Seven hundred and twenty-four 1st to 7th grade children (383 boys, 341 girls) were shown a picture depicting a crying infant, whereupon they were asked to generate the potential causes for infant crying along with the action responses that they might utilize to assist a crying baby. Self-reports of children's empathy-related responding were also obtained. As hypothesized, an age-related increase in the number, variety, and quality for causes for infant crying and strategies to help a crying infant were observed. Girls generated a higher mean number and variety of causes compared to boys. For older children (grades 4–7), dimensions of empathy-related responding, namely sympathy and perspective taking, were significantly associated with the number and variety of causes for infant crying and caregiving strategies. The findings support the conclusion for a developmental progression of understanding of facial expressions of infant crying across middle childhood.}

Three kinds of processing are proposed by Sternberg: meta-component (M), performance component (P) and knowledge acquisition component (K) processing. Sternberg proposes that M processing mediates P and K processing in novel tasks. With increasing expertise local processing systems are constructed and M processing becomes less dominant, relative to P and K processing. The subjects were 312 primary school children from levels 1 to 7 who were introduced for the first time to Logo programming during two school years. Performance measures were based on two programming tasks, a computer knowledge test, four cognitive tasks and several psychometric tests. The measures of M, P and K processing used while programming were based on planning and style of programming (M), accuracy of programming (P) and mode of programming (K). The interrelationship for M, P and K processing proposed by Sternberg was given empirical support. There was evidence of local processing by children with more expertise. The use of M, P and K processing was found to depend on the nature of the programming task and the level of programming expertise. General non-programming skills were found to predict M processing rather than P or K processing, although the relative contribution of non-programming skills and domain-specific knowledge and skill was dependent on the nature of the task and the child's level of expertise. There was some evidence of enhancement of the use of the general skills due to Logo experience.}

Responses to a series of ‘why questions' about two types of behaviours (liked and disliked) were collected and used as indices of the three types of motivation. Responses were initially coded into 10 motivational categories, and then into three motivational supercategories: intrinsic, extrinsic, and internalized. Reasons falling into these three categories were then examined for hypothesized age differences and differences in the frequencies of the categories for the two classes of behaviour. Support was found for the hypothesis that liked behaviours would be intrinsically motivated across the age range. In contrast, age group differences were obtained in the motivation for disliked behaviours, with extrinsic motivation showing higher frequencies at the younger ages and internalized motivation showing higher frequencies at the older ages. The importance children attributed to doing disliked behaviours was positively associated with internalized motivation. These results suggest that intrinsic and internalized motivations are conceptually and developmentally distinct motivational sources and thus should be examined separately in research on children's motivational development.}

Each person was asked to rate a set of 26 intelligence test items chosen from four popular scales (Stanford Binet, WAIS-R, WISC-R, and Raven's Progressive Matrices) on relevance to measuring intelligent behaviour, and on perceived difficulty after they had performed these tasks. The relevance ratings were taken as reflections of the group's concept of intelligence. The correlations of relevance ratings with perceived difficulty and with performance were negligible. This suggests that group differences in defining what constitutes intelligent behaviour across the three groups are not reflections of their own abilities in these tasks. Three types of skill were identified in each group by factor analytic techniques: Non-verbal reasoning, verbal reasoning and retrieval of information. Primary school children rated the verbal reasoning skill as most relevant to measuring intelligence, the high school students treated all three as equally relevant, and the college students rated the non-verbal reasoning skill to be the most relevant. This pattern of results is attributed to different task demands at primary schools, high schools, and colleges and to the changing basis on which people are differentiated.}

Recent advances in the field of affective computing have yielded impressive progress in automatically detecting facial expressions from pictures and videos. However, much of this work has yet to be widely disseminated in social science domains such as psychology. Current state-of-the-art models require considerable domain expertise that is not traditionally incorporated into social science training programs. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of user-friendly and open-source software that provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions that support facial expression research. In this paper, we introduce Py-Feat, an open-source Python toolbox that provides support for detecting, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing facial expression data. Py-Feat makes it easy for domain experts to disseminate and benchmark computer vision models and also for end users to quickly process, analyze, and visualize face expression data. We hope this platform will facilitate increased use of facial expression data in human behavior research.},

  abstract = {The association between shyness and children's likeability by peers was examined, with pragmatic difficulty and receptive and expressive vocabularies as moderators. Participants were 164 preschoolers (72 boys, 92 girls) between 52 and 79 months old in Singapore. A cross-informant methodology was used, with peers and teachers contributing to separate peer likeability ratings. The findings highlighted a conceptual distinction between peer- and teacher-rated likeability by peers. For the latter only, a 3-way interaction involving shyness, vocabulary, and pragmatic difficulty was found, indicating that for shy children with low vocabulary scores, those who experienced less pragmatic difficulty tended to be seen by teachers as more well-liked by peers than those with more pragmatic difficulty. This suggests that pragmatic skills may serve a protective function especially for shy children with poor vocabulary skills. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Child shyness is related to poorer peer acceptance and social competence Expressive vocabulary and pragmatic competence each has a buffering effect for shy children What the present study adds? Shyness is related to poorer peer likeability as assessed by teachers Shyness is unrelated to peer likeability as assessed by same- or different-sex peers Pragmatic skills buffer the effects of teacher-rated shyness only for children with poor receptive and expressive vocabularies The buffering effect of language ability is shown in a multilingual educational context},

  abstract = {This study investigates how 5- and 6-year-olds' evaluations of selfish, polite, and altruistic lies change as a result of whether these false statements are explicitly labelled as lies. We are also interested in how interpretive theory of mind may correlate with such evaluations with and without a lie label. Our results showed that labelling lowered children's evaluations for the polite and altruistic lies, but not for the selfish lies. Interpretive theory of mind correlated positively with the evaluation difference between the polite and altruistic lies and that between the selfish and altruistic lies in the label, but not in the non-label condition. Correlation between the selfish and altruistic lies and that between the polite and altruistic lies were stronger with than without labelling, after controlling for age, and verbal and non-verbal intelligence. We conclude that lie labelling biases children towards more negative evaluations for non-selfish lies and makes them see lies of different motives as more similar. If a lie label is applied, whether lies of different motives are still evaluated differently depends on interpretive theory of mind, which reflects the child's ability to represent and allow different interpretations of an ambiguous reality.},

The critical contributions of Becker (1992), Shadish (1992), and Viswesvaran and Ones (1995) in the early development of meta-analytic SEM are highlighted. Another goal of the paper is to illustrate how meta-analysis can be extended and integrated with other techniques to address new research questions such as the analysis of Big Data.

A key challenge for children is to engage control in a way that matches ever-changing demands of tasks. In addition to engagement of more control resources and more mature control strategies, developing executive function also requires that children coordinate available control strategies more flexibly as they age. More optimal coordination of control (or meta-control) ensures dynamic adjustment of control engagement to match more effectively moment-to-moment variations in the demands of tasks and results in more economic cognitive functioning.},

Participants heard stories describing characters commit trivial social transgressions, and then the next day, characters found themselves in the same situation that led to the previous transgression. For some story endings, participants were asked to predict and explain how the character felt, and for others, participants were told the character started to feel embarrassed and they were asked to explain why. Participants’ responses were coded and analysed using nonparametric statistical tests. Kruskal–Wallis analyses revealed significant developments occur between 6 and 8 years in children's understanding of embarrassment and their ability to explain individual's emotion as caused by anticipating the reoccurrence of a previous embarrassing event. Younger children demonstrated a basic knowledge of embarrassment but failed to demonstrate more advanced understanding of the emotion. Findings from the current study indicate children reach a more mature understanding of embarrassment and the implications of committing social transgressions between 7 and 8 years. Finally, the current study contributes to the literature on children's ability to infer mental states and temporally connect experiences.},

The participants were 119 children from a lower income community, between the ages of 3 and 5, who completed an executive function battery and tests of an understanding of mind. The correlation data suggested a link between siblings and executive control and between theory of mind and executive control but, surprisingly, not between siblings and theory of mind. A further experiment with 71 children indirectly highlighted the potential contaminating influence of socio-economic status (SES) on the sibling advantage in theory of mind. Multiple regression analyses, controlling for age and verbal IQ, discriminated between the types of executive processes most likely to predict performance in mental understanding. The implications of this result are discussed in terms of a ‘primary’ and 'secondary’ executive deficit account.}

Yet, the presence of subcortical neuronal and glial “interstitial” cells expressing immunolabelled neurotransmitters/neuromodulators and synaptic vesicular proteins, and recent immunohistochemical and electrophysiological observations on the rat visual cortex as well as interactive regulation of myelinating processes support the possibility that SWM nests subcortical, regionally variable, distributed neuronal–glial circuits, that could influence information transfer. Their hypothetical involvement in regulating the timing and signal transfer probability at the SWM axonal components ought to be considered and experimentally analysed. Thus, the “interstitial” neuronal cells—associated with local glial cells—traditionally considered to be vestigial and functionally inert under normal conditions, they may well turn to be critical in regulating information transfer at the SWM.},

  abstract = {530 MEDICINA - VolumenIS 6S0N - 0N0º2 45,- 27060800 EDITORIAL MEDICINA (Buenos Aires) 2000; 60: 530-532 Comentarios a propósito del cerebro de Albert Einstein Con un cierto nivel de sano escepticismo podría afirmarse que el conocimiento no es sino una cambiante construcción de imaginarios, sometido a veces a cuestionables criterios de verdad. Dentro de esa "fluidez" o relatividad del conocimiento el método científico permite generar modelos verificables de la realidad, es decir, de nuestras representaciones de la realidad (o imaginarios). Pero aún así, ello no alcanza para evitar ponencias insólitas que demuestran la penetración de lo prejuicioso, lo ideológico o lo mágico. Y entonces lo imaginario se transforma en profecía autocumplida. Un caso particularmente notable por sus implicaciones sociopolíticas fue el referido a la pretendida relación entre capacidad craneana e inteligencia aplicada al análisis comparado de razas humanas, que agudamente S. Gould analizó y desautorizó en su libro, de lectura obligada, titulado Mismeasure of Man. Otra instancia fue la de un célebre científico, Oscar Vogt, quien especuló con excesivo entusiasmo y convicción acerca de la existencia de características histológicas que supuestamente fundamentaban la "superior capacidad mental" del para entonces maltrecho cerebro de V.I. Lenin (resultado de varios episodios isquémicos)1, 2. Más recientemente, el cerebro de un célebre Homo sapiens sapiens ha dado motivo a la expresión de nuevos "imaginarios". No ya relacionada con la propuesta según la cual la inteligencia se evidenciaría en configuraciones cerebrales (o craneanas si nos remontáramos al siglo XIX) sino aún más, la propia genialidad. Si en vida Albert Einstein fue un personaje polémico en el sentido más creativo de la palabra, su cerebro se ha transformado en objeto de un debate que en última instancia pareciera revivir antiguos pleitos entre lo imaginario y lo científico. La gran diferencia es que lo segundo no se satisface con lo intuitivamente atractivo y requiere de una dialéctica basada en evidencias y criterios de verdad formales. Luego de un insólito y azaroso periplo, porciones del cerebro de Einstein han sido derivadas a unos pocos laboratorios para su examen con fines de investigación científica. Entre ellos, el del autor de esta nota, quien lo recibiera con el fin de analizar otras cuestiones de interés científico3 (muestras provistas originariamente por el Dr. T. S. Harvey, anatomopatólogo que realizó la autopsia, y posteriormente por el Dr. E. Krause, Universidad de Princeton, USA). El objetivo explícito de otros estudiosos ha sido el de intentar aproximar una respuesta al intento, poco feliz a mi juicio, de establecer posibles correlatos de su genialidad basándose en el análisis de un cerebro en condiciones post mortem. Este planteo recuerda antiguas ponencias localizacionistas, que aún impregna el conocimiento de muchos, por las cuales se adjudicaban aptitudes intelectuales, comportamientos específicos y desvíos criminales a zonas específicas del cerebro y su tamaño relativo. Esta ponencia contradice el concepto modular y distribuido del funcionamiento cerebral y los procesos cognitivos, sostenido por el pensamiento predominante en la neurociencia actual. Lo cierto es que si el cerebro de Einstein tenía características propias, dada su condición de genio, dos observaciones iniciales forzaron la necesidad de recrear la supuesta fundamentación del imaginario. Su peso global estaba por debajo de la media para individuos de similar edad, y el espesor de su corteza cerebral era menor también, pero con mayor densidad neuronal4. ¿Cómo congeniar esas observaciones iniciales con la dimensión cognitiva del genio? Estos autores propusieron entonces que el menor grosor de la corteza cerebral y el aumento de la densidad neuronal con toda probabilidad reducirían los tiempos de procesamiento e intercambio de información, lo cual redundaría en una mayor eficiencia operativa. Sin embargo, una observación de naturaleza similar en cuanto a la densidad EDITORIALES 531 neuronal en muestras de cerebros de pacientes esquizofrénicos fue asociada con la patología psiquiátrica de estos pacientes así como de aquellos con deficiencia mental y no con un incremento de la capacidad cognitiva5, 6. Como vemos, estas interpretaciones dispares para similares observaciones estructurales, sólo podrían adquirir valor informativo si se las correlacionara (estructura-función) en un número adecuado de casos. Cabría acotar entonces que mientras en el trabajo de Selemon y colaboradores se estudiaron nueve casos de esquizofrenia, en el trabajo en consideración la afirmación que se hace está basada en un solo caso, el del cerebro de A. Einstein. De todos modos cabría también la especulación de que una densidad neuronal aumentada podría deberse a una reducción en el número o complejidad de los procesos celulares y no a un mero acortamiento de procesos, como queda implicado en la interpretación de dichos autores. En tal caso el aumento de la densidad neuronal sería producto de una pérdida de elementos de conectividad celular. Ya que no existen espacios vacíos en el cerebro, cabría entonces preguntarse a expensas de qué otra estructura se produjo la reducción del grosor de la corteza cerebral de Einstein y el aumento de la densidad neuronal? ¿A expensas del espacio extracelular? No pareciera ser el mejor candidato, por el compromiso que significaría para la movilidad iónica/molecular. ¿A expensas de los procesos astrogiales? En general a edades avanzadas hay una tendencia al incremento de territorios gliales (astrogliosis). Y esto plantea otro interrogante. Las características observadas en dicho cerebro en cuanto a grosor cortical y densidad neuronal, ¿se corresponderían con las que se hubieran observado a una edad joven? Lamentablemente esta pregunta no tiene respuesta posible salvo que pudieran hacerse inferencias basadas en la población general. Y entonces utilizaríamos argumentos contradictorios con la pretendida unicidad del cerebro de Einstein. Parecida apreciación merece la publicitada relación entre células neuronales y células de la astroglía, en favor de un incremento de estas últimas en el área 397 y no en otras áreas, comparado con otros cerebros. La astroglía se halla íntimamente vinculada con la neurona y, en condiciones normales, sin aquella ésta no sólo no podría cumplir su cometido sino que no sobreviviría un instante. Asimismo, dicha área 39 ha sido asociada con la representación visuo-espacial, aparentemente involucrada en forma crítica en el pensamiento matemático. En este sentido es interesante señalar que en trabajos publicados recientemente8, 9 se propone la existencia de dos sistemas neuronales para el pensamiento matemático: uno requeriría un formato lingüístico y otro, supuestamente vinculado con el pensamiento matemático aproximado, requeriría de la participación de sistemas neuronales representados en ambos lóbulos parietales. Por otra parte, los datos de la relación neurono:glial se basaron en el análisis de cortes histológicos procesados con técnicas de tinción menos específicas para los varios subtipos celulares de la glía que con las que se cuenta hoy en día. Además, en un trabajo muy crítico10 se detallan falencias estadísticas y de diseño del trabajo de Diamond et al.7, incluyendo diferencias de fijación e inclusión del tejido con fines de conservación y análisis histológico. Al margen de tales críticas, en nuestros preparados procesados para un marcador específico de la astroglía (proteína ácida gliofibrilar, GFAP), fue posible observar un moderado incremento en el número de células de la astroglía con inmunomarcación en láminas superficiales de algunas áreas corticales, no distinta de la que en general puede llegar a observarse en cerebros añosos. Sin embargo, tal astrogliosis es variable entre áreas de un mismo cerebro y en una misma población de individuos añosos. Recordemos que al momento de su fallecimiento Einstein contaba con 76 años. La población seleccionada por Diamond et al.7 era de 47 a 80 años, por lo que es dable esperar una significativa variación en la expresión de dicho proceso y, dada la presencia de cerebros mucho más jóvenes, una menor expresión promedio de astrogliosis a comparación de la del cerebro de Einstein. No es posible actualmente determinar si esa astrogliosis de la senectud es un proceso autónomo (senil) de la astroglía, o reactivo subsiguiente a fenómenos de muerte neuronal durante la vida, o a procesos generales de reducción de intercambio iónico y metabólico entre la circulación sanguínea y el parénquima cerebral. Por lo tanto, aparte de otras consideraciones, no es necesario que el publicitado 532 MEDICINA - Volumen 60 - Nº 4, 2000 aumento relativo de la glia del área 39 represente una característica innata sino que pudo ser adquirida en razón de un proceso senil. Es decir, podría en realidad representar un proceso vinculado con el deterioro senil y no con las aptitudes funcionales del insigne cerebro analizado. Además, ¿sobre qué argumentos objetivos, y no exclusivamente especulativos, puede afirmarse que un aumento relativo en el número de células gliales se correlaciona con un procesamiento más eficiente de la información?. Finalmente, la observación de una variación inusual en la girificación del cerebro de Einstein, consistente en el incremento en el área parietal inferior vinculada a una modificación de la cisura de Silvio, no observada en una colección de cerebros normales, tiene todo el valor heurístico de una observación cuyo significado funcional, en cuanto a la genialidad de su portador, es imposible de determinar. La gran variedad interindividual en la morfología externa y la microestructura del cerebro, así como las relaciones dinámicamente integradas entre áreas de la corteza cerebral, obliga a relativizar el probable significado funcional de tales observaciones. Este tipo de hipótesis que propone establecer una relación causal entre una característica funcional del cerebro con una desviación en su morfología externa, por razones obvias, es muy difícil de ser sometida a prueba. Tal vez las nuevas técnicas de análisis por imágenes permita con el tiempo acumular suficiente experiencia acerca de un hipotético significado o correlato funcional de las variaciones en la girificación cortical. En conclusión, por frustrante que ello sea, no es posible derivar, razonablemente, de la mera observación de la morfología externa y la estructura del cerebro de Albert Einstein, sus especiales características funcionales. Como así tampoco asumir que las características observadas son correlatos necesarios de la genialidad. Esto podría interpretarse como una contribución final de este emblemático Homo sapiens sapiens a enriquecer la discusión de cuestiones fundamentales en neurociencia. Pero más allá de estas disquisiciones relativas a aspectos cerebrales estructurales, y de una justificada curiosidad por la configuración del cerebro de un genio, razones estrictamente conceptuales relativas al funcionamiento cerebral hubieran desalentado ab initio estos intentos por determinar a partir de un análisis post mortem la búsqueda de evidencias relativas al posible sustrato orgánico de la genialidad.

  abstract = {Glial cytoarchitecture in human cerebral cortex is constituted by two overlapping layouts: the (general mammalian) bglial syncytiumQ and the (primate-specific) binterlaminar glial palisadeQ (IGP) composed by astroglial cells, with long, radial processes that traverse several supragranular layers. In this study, the emergence and early organization of the IGP was analyzed using immunocytochemical procedures in postmortem infantile human control and age matched, Down’s syndrome (DS) cases. In control cases, first signs of a radial array of unbranched astroglial processes were apparent at the end of the period of bphysiological astrocytosisQ (20–40 days of postnatal life), and its general profile (except perhaps the density of cell processes) reached the adultlike configuration by the second month of life. The initial organization of the IGP was similar in control and DS cases, although a breakdown in DS became manifest by the first year of age, or earlier, albeit with individual variations. These changes tended to evolve in a bmosaicQ fashion and included partial disruption of the palisade, or persistence of the bphysiological astrocytosisQ. These observations were compared against samples from elder DS cases with an Alzheimer’s type of dementia (AtD). Collectively, results suggest that DS also involves astroglial alterations during early stages of brain development, and that those changes progress with age, until an AtD ensues during adult life.},

To examine its presence in human cerebral cortex, samples of frontal and temporal cerebral cortices were obtained during programmed brain surgery from a young patient with an intraventricular astrocytoma, and from one young and two adult patients with frontal and temporal lobe focal epilepsy, respectively. Samples of the visual cortex were also obtained at an autopsy of an 84-year-old woman without any known neurological disease. Brain tissues were processed for GFAP-IR immunocytochemistry. Long, interlaminar, GFAP-IR astroglial processes of usually 300–500 mm, but occasionally reaching almost 1,000 mm, were observed. These processes resembled those previously described in the cerebral cortex of adult New World monkeys. Available data suggest that they may represent a predominant characteristic in postnatal primate cerebral cortex. EM analysis of club-like endings disclosed a multilamellar organization of GFAP-IR intermediate filaments, and the presence of mitochondria and amorphous, electron dense material. Their possible function is yet to be determined},

Expression of synaptic vesicle-associated proteins, excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT1 and EAAT2) and GABAA Rα2 receptor produced coarse punctate labeling in human adult white matter astrocytes. A finer, generalized, punctate labeling was observed in human infants and adult C. apella monkeys. Labeling of neuronal somata and processes with microtubule-associated proteins (MAP2a–c) and neuron nuclear (NeuN) antibodies, was also observed in subcortical white matter of humans and monkeys.

  abstract = {Evidence for ‘‘cable-like’’ processes stemming from astroglial cells in the supragranular cerebral cortex has been recently presented. In addition to what could be called the ‘‘general mammalian-like’’ astroglial architecture (the so-called ‘‘panglial syncytium’’) of the cerebral cortex, composed of typical stellate astrocytes (intralaminar astrocytes), the anthropoid species, mostly catarrhines, show a manifest vertical, radial distribution of long (interlaminar) astroglial processes. It can be tentatively proposed that evolutionary pressures resulted in the progressive appearance, in primates, of a new type of glial cell. Its soma has a superficial location and unusually long cellular processes that invade, in a predominant radial fashion, the supragranular region of the cerebral cortex. Their existence has been ignored for more than a century. On the neuronal side, modular (columnar) organization of the cerebral cortex may represent an evolutionary acquisition that could optimize communication and information processing, with the least volume compromise in terms of wiring. Yet, for such columns to be functionally operative, adequate isolation from neighboring units would be required. A ‘‘mass’’ operation of the astroglial architecture would tend to compromise spatial definition and the degrees of freedom of such columnar modules. It is proposed that the presence of a ‘‘palisade’’ of interlaminar glial processes represents a relatively recent evolutionary event, instrumental for the optimization of the modular (columnar) organization of the cerebral cortex. It is interesting that the supragranular cortical region has undergone the largest growth among mammalian species during brain evolution, and has been associated with a crucial role in cortico – cortical interactions.},

These anthropoid species were missing from previous phylogenetic descriptions of astroglia with interlaminar processes, a characteristic event of the cerebral cortex within the Primate Order. Pongo pygmaeus (orangutan), Gorilla gorilla (gorilla) and Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) brain samples showed the typical “palisade” of interlaminar processes. Yet, those from Pan troglodytes were less uniform, showing extended cortical segments with astrocytic (“syncytial-type”) appearance, intermingled with segments expressing the interlaminar “palisade”. Present observations contribute to fill in missing data on the phylogenetic emergence of the cerebral cortex astroglial interlaminar processes. Considering the extreme consistency of the expression of astroglial interlaminar “palisades” among anthropoid species, this apparent variability among Pan individuals could be due to various possibilities, which are considered in this report.},

The incidental observation (serendipity) of longer than expected glial processes in the superficial layers of the cerebral cortex in hemiparkinsonian Cebus apella monkeys, was expanded afterwards to cover the largest possible sampling of representatives of mammalian orders and species, as well as in experimental and pathological conditions, in human and non-human primates. The term interlaminar was coined to differentiate these processes from the classical astroglial stellate, intralaminar ones. Such account grew to the point of inspiring, on speculative grounds, possible roles in the organization of the cerebral cortex. Interlaminar glial processes represent an essentially primate characteristic, affected by neuropathological conditions such as DS and AD and experimental procedures affecting normal sensory input, suggesting thalamic involvement in their normal expression. Their ontogenetic development, phylogenetic evolution and aging changes are described.},

For this purpose, and in order to follow possible correlations in the general organization of neuronal and astroglial elements, immunocytochemical procedures for Glial Fibrillary Acid Protein (GFAP) and Microtubule Associated Protein 2 (MAP-2), in addition to cytochrome oxidase (COX) histochemistry, were applied to tangential and coronal sections and analyzed by using computer-assisted procedures. Astroglial interlaminar processes stemming from superficial laminae did not traverse lamina IVA, and thus did not appear in deeper layers. Clearly definable interlaminar processes were predominantly concentrated in laminae II–III. A honeycomb- like lattice was observed in tangential sections, with a ‘‘cell’’ size distribution similar to the MAP-2-IR lattice, suggesting an intimate association with the pyramidal columns. Additionally, analysis of similar sections disclosed the periodic appearance of large patches with high density of interlaminar processes, indicating a nonhomogeneous distribution of GFAP-IR processes in the striate cortex. COX ‘‘blobs’’ appeared frequently to coincide with areas expressing high density of GFAP-IR elements. These findings add a new perspective to current concepts of astroglial organization in the striate cortex of primates and reveal the existence of a non-neuronal modular organization in the primate striate cerebral cortex, and suggest that possible correlations between relative distributions of neuronal and astroglial elements should be further analyzed in cortical areas with a clear modular organization such as the striate cortex.

The functional role of these processes in the primate cerebral cortex is largely unknown. The development and standardization of procedures that could maximize the utilization of primate brain samples is required for the experimental analysis of the individual and collective dynamic properties of interlaminar glial processes. With this aim and in order to assess the relative stability of these glial processes in ex vivo conditions, “tissue printing” procedures were applied. “Tissue printing” allows for the acute transfer of cellular elements from fresh tissue onto an artificial substrate. Human, monkey (Cebus apella), and rat brain samples were subjected to “tissue printing” procedures followed by cell culture and immunohistochemistry. For the purpose of comparing the efficiency of this procedure on the transfer of other long glial processes, “tissue prints” of radial glial processes from neonatal rats and of Bergmann glia from cerebellar samples of adult rats were included. Nitrocellulose (with and without added fibronectin or laminin) produced the best attachment results. Interlaminar processes were not modified following 24-h incubation in a cell culture medium, with the addition of agents known to modify astroglial morphotypes in vitro (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, 40 mM K؉, or fetal calf serum). It is concluded that glia with interlaminar processes can be detached from fresh tissue using “tissue printing” procedures, can be maintained for at least 24 h in standard culture conditions, and showed a stable morphological phenotype. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Thirty-five infants (18 girls) were administered pointing and intention-understanding tasks at the age of 12 and 15 months. Children were again evaluated at the age of 39 months with perception and intention tasks, and a psychological explanation task. Results showed that only 12-month-olds' comprehension of the pointing gesture with an imperative motive contributed to the prediction of later understanding of perception and mentalistic explanations of actions. Moreover, the ability of 12- and 15-month-olds to understand intentions contributed to the prediction of later preschool understanding of perceptions and intentions. These results indicate that a developmental trajectory in children's understanding of mental states from infancy to childhood is present, but depends on the level of engagement and communication that are required to perform these tasks.}

  abstract = {‘Strong conformity’ corresponds to the public endorsement of majority opinions that are in blatant contradiction to one's own correct perceptual judgements of the situation. We tested strong conformity inference by 3- and 5-year-old children using a third-person perspective paradigm. Results show that at neither age, children spontaneously expect that an ostracized third-party individual who wants to affiliate with the majority group will show strong conformity. However, when questioned as to what the ostracized individual should do to befriend others, from 5 years of age children explicitly demonstrate that they construe strong conformity as a strategic means of social affiliation. Additional data suggest that strong and strategic conformity understanding from an observer's third-person perspective is linked to the passing of the language-mediated false belief theory of mind task, an index of children's emerging ‘meta’ ability to construe the mental state of others. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? ‘Strong conformity’ corresponds to the public endorsement of majority opinions that are in blatant contradiction to one's own correct perceptual judgements of the situation. Asch's (1956, Psychological Monographs: General and Applied, 70, 1) classic demonstration of strong conformity with adults has been replicated with preschool children: 3- to 4-year-olds manifest signs of strong conformity by reversing about thirty to forty per cent of the time their correct perceptual judgements to fit with contradictory statements held unanimously by other individuals (Corriveau \& Harris, 2010, Developmental Psychology, 46, 437; Corriveau et al., 2013, Journal of Cognition and Culture, 13, 367; Haun \& Tomasello, 2011, Child Development, 82, 1759). As for adults, strong conformity does not obliterate children's own private, accurate knowledge of the situation. It is in essence a public expression to fit the group and alleviate social dissonance. What does this study add? In three experiments, we explored the developmental emergence in the preschool years of strong conformity inference from a third-person perspective. Results show that by 5 years of age, and not earlier, children begin to construe strong conformity as a strategy that someone should use to gain social affiliation, even though they do not anticipate that a third-party individual would necessarily resort to such strategy. Additional data suggest that strong and strategic conformity understanding from an observer's third-person perspective is linked to the passing of the language-mediated false belief theory of mind task.},

  abstract = {Research in non-human animal (hereafter, animal) cognition has found strong evidence that some animal species are capable of meta-cognitively monitoring their mental states. They know when they know and when they do not know. In contrast, animals have generally not shown robust theory of mind (ToM) capabilities. Comparative research uses methods that are non-verbal, and thus might easily be labelled ‘implicit’ using the terminology of traditional human cognition. However, comparative psychology has developed several non-verbal methods that are designed to test for aspects of meta-cognition that – while perhaps not fully explicit – go beyond the merely implicit or associative. We believe similar methods might be useful to developmental researchers who work with young children, and may provide a sound empirical alternative to verbal reports. Comparative psychology has moved away from all-or-none categorical labels (e.g., ‘implicit’ vs. ‘explicit’) towards a theoretical framework that contains a spectrum of mental abilities ranging from implicit to explicit, and from associative to cognitive to fully conscious. We discuss how this same framework might be applied to developmental psychology when it comes to implicit versus explicit processing and ToM.}

This was tested by comparing performance on the cardination test displays with performance on such displays with guidelines added to make pairing easier. Both 5-year-olds and 7-year-olds took part. Guidelines helped both age groups; the 7-year-olds more than the 5-year-olds. There were very marked differences between the age groups.}

When projecting forwards in time, however, they made only quantitative changes and it is only at age 7 that children begin to make qualitative changes. In a second task, the children were asked to allocate drawings of varying complexity to artists of different ages. Whereas most 5-year-olds allocated a ready-drawn tadpole figure to an appropriately aged drawer, they were not able to allocate more complex figures appropriately. In contrast, 7-year-olds were quite adept at this task.}

Each child drew three figures: a man standing and facing the viewer, a man running towards the right, and a man running towards the viewer. The older children's figures were rated more highly than those of younger children, supporting previous research findings. Girls' figures received higher ratings than those of boys, contradicting previous claims that boys are more flexible in their drawings of figures in action. Japanese children's figures received higher ratings than those in the UK, suggesting that Japanese children are influenced by a greater exposure to graphic images in their school art curriculum and the widespread popularity of manga comics. The prediction that Japanese boys would make the greatest adaptations to their figures (since manga comics for boys contain more action figures) was not supported. As well as gaining higher ratings, the older children also constructed their figures in more complex ways than did the younger children. The figures drawn by girls and by the Japanese children were not constructed differently from those of boys or UK children; their higher ratings were attributed to their greater facility in the execution of their constructions.}

Here, we compared speed and fluency of text production when children aged between 6 and 11 used either a pen or a computer keyboard. Younger children were reliably slower and less fluent when writing at a keyboard. All children were slower when the text was more demanding. These impediments to smooth writing were shown to be associated with the different patterns of visual attention required by the two writing tools. It is argued that writing is usefully approached as a tool-mediated activity whose coordination presents developmental challenges. Moreover, the results suggest grounds for investing more in helping children towards greater confidence in visual–manual control of the keyboard.}

  abstract = {When young children draw a scene in which one object partially occludes another, they often depict hidden features of the occluded object by rendering the nearer object transparent. This may signify a motive to produce drawings that are informative. Three experiments are reported in which a simple paradigm is employed to consider this possible basis of transparency drawing. Experiment 1 established a gradual decrease in the use of this device across the 5–7-year age range. Its occurrence could not be ascribed to a simple lack of graphic skill and it was not readily inhibited by stronger perceptual marking of scene boundaries. The extent to which children were purposefully producing informative drawings was evaluated in Expts 2 and 3. Because an increase in occluded information actually served to inhibit transparencies, it is argued that they need not reflect such a communicative attitude. An alternative account is proposed whereby drawing decisions are guided, sometimes inappropriately, by the structure of cognitive representations children form of scenes. Transparencies signify a failure to anticipate certain graphic ambiguities thereby generated. However, they may be inhibited if the geometry of a particular scene forces the child to confront such ambiguity at the outset of drawing.}

Mother and child EFs were modestly correlated by 24 months of age, and this association was stable through 48 months. Importantly, maternal–child EF associations were still robust after controlling for verbal ability (potential indicator of verbal/crystallized intelligence) and maternal education (correlate of socio-economic status and verbal intelligence). Potential implications of these findings as well as underlying mechanisms of the maternal–child EF association (gene–environment interplay) are discussed.},

The developmental pathway of the SRE has proved difficult to chart, because the standard SRE task is unsuitable for young children. The current inquiry was designed to address this issue using an ownership paradigm, as encoding objects in the context of self-ownership have been shown to elicit self-referential memory advantages in adults. Pairs of 4- to 6-year-old children (n = 64) sorted toy pictures into self- and other-owned sets. A surprise recognition memory test revealed a significant advantage for toys owned by self, which decreased with age. Neither verbal ability nor theory of mind attainment predicted the size of the memory advantage for self-owned items. This finding suggests that contrary to some previous reports, memory in early childhood can be shaped by the same self-referential biases that pervade adult cognition.}

This pilot study estimated the prevalence of paternal depression and mood state, and assessed the relationship between paternal mood and infant temperament. The participants in the study were 98 fathers of newborn babies. Fathers were initially screened for depressed mood (Hospital anxiety and depression scale, and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale), and at 6 months parental mood, infant temperament, couple relationship quality, alcohol use, adverse life events, parenting, and demographics were recorded. Infant fussiness was analysed in relation to paternal mood and other contextual factors using multiple regression. Of the 98 fathers, 48 (49\%) completed depression-screening measures. Of these 48 fathers, 4 (8\%) reported depressive symptoms above the cut-off for case definition. A total of 48\% (N=19) completed measures at follow-up. In the adjusted model, higher paternal depression scores, more traditional attitudes towards fathering, and increased recent life events were related to higher infant fussiness scores; and better couple relationship quality was related to lower fussiness scores. This study showed that 1 in 12 fathers had depressed mood, and lower mood was associated with negative infant temperament. Since the findings of this feasibility study were based on a small sample size the association of paternal mood and child development merits further study using a larger sample of fathers.}

However, more recent evidence suggests that young children distinguish between domains of social transgression and justify moral judgements with reference to the transgression itself, rather than to external features such as rules, authority directives, or sanctions. The present study hypothesized a possible explanation for this discrepancy: that undifferentiated reasoning occurs with the use of unfamiliar stimulus events or stimulus events not clearly differentiated with respect to social domain. Sixty-one 6-, 8-, and 10-year-olds were interviewed about four types of social transgression: familiar moral, unfamiliar moral, familiar conventional, and unfamiliar conventional. Assessments were made of several dimensions of judgement hypothesized to be criterial for the differentiation of social domains; responses were also analysed for types of justification used. For familiar stimuli all age groups showed a differentiated understanding of moral and conventional issues, both in judgement and in justification. Younger subjects showed less differentiation in judgement than older subjects when stimuli were unfamiliar. Age differences were also found in the types of justification given, both for familiar and for unfamiliar moral issues. The findings indicate that stimulus familiarity is a more significant factor in the moral reasoning of younger than of older children.}

A group of 107 children ranging in age from 4 to 9 years completed three reaction time (RT) tasks (spatial, verbal and selective attention). Children were grouped first by chronological age then by fluid IQ, and Brinley plots of RT and RT difference scores (argued to give a purer measure of cognitive speed) were produced for each grouping. Two Brinley methods were compared: fixing the intercept of the line of best fit at the origin, and allowing it to vary. These produced quite different functions with correspondingly different implications for the speed theory. It is argued that previous findings of developmental speed increases (as measured by Brinley slope) may be an artifact of the fixed-intercept method. When intercept was allowed to vary, findings indicated that speed did not change developmentally. Furthermore, when absolute RT and RT difference score findings were compared, partial correlations indicated that RT was related primarily to age rather than MA or IQ, whereas RT difference scores were related directly to IQ, but not to age or MA. We argue that the results are best accommodated by the theory that speed underlies stable IQ differences but not increases in MA. Instead, we argue that MA change may be better accounted for by children's increasing attentional ability.}

Here, we tested a cumulative risk hypothesis of adult social functioning and health outcomes in the fourth decade of life, using the oldest known longitudinally followed cohort of survivors of extremely low birthweight (ELBW; {$<$}1,000 g). We investigated the additional impact of peer victimization in youth on social outcomes at age 29–36 years in ELBW survivors and matched normal birthweight (NBW; {$>$}2,500 g) participants. In the combined sample, peer victimization was associated with lower likelihood of having children and household income, poorer family functioning and self-esteem, more loneliness and chronic health conditions, less social support, and increased likelihood for contact with police. Moderation analyses indicated that among ELBW survivors, compared to their NBW counterparts, victimization was more strongly associated with being convicted of a crime and with having chronic health conditions. These findings highlight the negative long-term impact of peer victimization on all children and that some outcomes may be differentially affected by prenatal and early post-natal environments. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject Exposure to early adversity has deleterious effects on brain-behaviour relations across the lifespan. Extremely premature children have higher rates of exposure to adversities, including peer victimization. Peer victimization is associated with adverse outcomes in adulthood in those born at term. What does this study add? Victimization negatively impacts the social outcomes of those born extremely premature and at term into adulthood. Associations appear to be affected by individual differences in prenatal and early post-natal environments. Intervention is crucial when peer victimization occurs in children at risk, as well as those typically developing.},

In Experiment 1 an opaque black screen was positioned just below the blocks' starting position. In Experiment 2 the screen was put at the height of the container rim and thus occluded the critical arrival phase of the trajectory. Results showed that looking times depended on what infants perceived as happening at the height of the rim and not on what they could have perceived before the block reached the opening, such as the absolute size of the objects. In contrast, older infants looked longer at an obstructed passage of the block into the container, irrespective of the position of the screen.}

  abstract = {In this study, new evidence is presented of marked sex differences in the distribution of insecure attachment patterns in middle childhood. Attachment was assessed with the Manchester Child Attachment Story Task (MCAST) in a sample of 122 Italian 7-year-olds. The four-way distribution of attachment patterns was significantly unbalanced, with insecure boys more often avoidant (27\%) than ambivalent (2\%), and insecure girls more often ambivalent (25\%) than avoidant (4\%). In addition, boys were rated as more severely disorganized than girls on a continuous disorganization score. A survey of previous literature strongly collaborates these findings, showing that similar attachment distributions have been obtained cross-culturally (US, Canada, and Israel) in nearly all of the (relatively few) studies in which children's sex had been taken into account. It is argued that sex biases in attachment avoidance/ambivalence become apparent starting at about 6–7 years, in contrast with the lack of sex-related effects in infancy and early childhood, and probably anticipate the pattern of sex differences found in adults with romantic attachment questionnaires.}

  abstract = {One of the most common forms of interaction between parents and young children is picturebook reading. This study examined both the structure and content of picturebook interactions of 30 mothers and their 12-, 15-, or 18-month-old infants. Structural aspects of the interaction were relatively constant over the age range studied: For all three age groups the mothers controlled the interactions and took responsibility for determining which of the pictures would be talked about. The content of the interactions varied as a function of the age of the child. More active participation was demanded of older children. They were asked more questions by their mothers, and the information provided to them was more complex. For all age groups, maternal questioning was related to the mother's beliefs about her child's word knowledge; the mother was more likely to ask the child to label a picture if she thought the child knew that label. The results are interpreted in terms of the scaffolding construct. They reveal a general maternal orientation to elicit the best possible performance from the child. Several forms of maternal support are discussed.}

A sample of 46 preschoolers and their mothers discussed photographs of infants showing eight emotions; mothers also simulated sadness and anger. Transcribed conversations were coded for frequency and function of emotion language. During both tasks, mothers talked more than their children about emotions; however, the frequencies of emotion utterances which served as unelaborated comments, or to guide the other's behaviour, did not differ for mothers and children. Older children and mothers explained emotions more overall; Cyear-olds commented on the babies' emotions more than 3-year-olds. Mothers' and children's emotion language were related in interpretable ways. Aspects of emotion language emitted by both mothers and children were related to indices of positive social-emotional development, such as emotion knowledge and positivity of emotional displays observed in the preschool.}

Measurement focused on emotions children would feel during these situations, and their behaviour response decisions. Participants most often chose sad and angry emotions, and socially competent and passive behaviours. Relations were found between sad emotion and socially competent behaviour choices, as well as between angry emotion and aggressive behaviour choices. Sad emotion and socially competent behaviour responses contributed to variance in contemporaneous and later school adjustment and kindergarten academic readiness. There was evidence that the contributions of sad emotion responses were mediated by those of socially competent behaviour choices. Results bolstered calls to include emotion in SIP measures, supported predictive validity for this SIP measure in a large representative sample of preschoolers, and pointed to fruitful pathways for future research.}

A matched subjects design was used with experimental and control infants matched on sex, birth weight, gestation and Apgar scores. In the short term, the experimental groups are found to bottle feed and be discharged home significantly earlier than the control group. At 15 months the experimental group showed accelerated cognitive development in comparison to the control group. No significant difference was found between the groups in their motor development. The long-term result on the cognitive measure should be considered with caution given the limitations of the study and the role of possible mediating mechanisms, such as heightened parental expectation and altered parent-infant interaction, which have yet to be examined.}

  abstract = {Deception is a controversial aspect of theory of mind, and researchers disagree about whether it entails an understanding of the false beliefs of one's opponent. The present study asks whether children with delayed language and delayed explicit false belief reasoning can succeed on explicit deception tasks. Participants were 45 orally taught deaf children with varying language delays aged 4.5–8 years and 45 hearing children aged 3.5–6 years. Participants received a battery of language, executive function, deception, and both verbal and low-verbal false belief tasks. The result reveal a dissociation of deception and false belief tasks: the deaf children are on par with their hearing peers on deception games, but show significant delays in false belief tasks even when the language demands are made minimal. Furthermore, different skills are predictors of success for the two types of task in the deaf children: language, and in particular complement syntax, is the best predictor of false belief reasoning; but executive function skills, especially inhibitory control, are the best predictors of deception. It is argued that deception at this level can be handled by behaviour rules without reference to mental states.}

Recently, inducing self-awareness (by looking at oneself in a mirror) was found to be effective in promoting young Western children's honesty. The present investigation compared the effectiveness of this self-awareness technique to a novel other-awareness technique (looking at a photograph of a peer) in promoting young Chinese children's honesty. Chinese children aged 3 and 4 years (N = 121) completed a modified temptation resistance paradigm where they were requested not to peek at a toy in the experimenter's absence. Children were randomly assigned to a Self-Awareness, Peer (other-awareness), or Control condition. When asked whether they peeked at the toy, children in the Self-Awareness condition were significantly more likely to tell the truth compared to those in the Control condition. No significant differences in truth-telling emerged between the Peer and Control conditions. The present results demonstrate the cross-cultural application of self-awareness as an honesty promoting technique with young children. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? High rates of dishonesty persist across cultures. Social and cultural values can shape lie-telling behaviours. Inducing self-awareness promotes honesty in Western children. What does this study add? A tool for promoting honesty in non-Western cultures. Inducing self-awareness promotes honesty in Chinese children. Inducing other-awareness was not effective in promoting honesty in Chinese children.},

Children were presented with vignettes describing hypothetical peers displaying shy, unsociable, avoidant, and socially competent behaviours and were then asked a series of questions to assess their beliefs about the implications of these different behaviours. Young children made distinctions between social withdrawal subtypes in terms of underlying motivations and emotions. Children also appeared to hold differential beliefs about the implications of different forms of social withdrawal: Of note, they anticipated that socially avoidant peers would experience the most negative outcomes. These findings provide some of the first evidence to suggest that social avoidance represents a distinct form of social withdrawal among young Chinese children. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of distinguishing between different subtypes of social withdrawal in Chinese culture.},

  abstract = {Research on executive function in early childhood has flourished in recent years. Much of this work is premised on a view of development of executive function as the emergence of a set of domain-general component processes (e.g., working memory updating, inhibitory control, shifting). This view has shaped how we think about relations between executive function and other aspects of development, the role of the environment in executive-function development, and how best to improve executive function in children who struggle with it. However, there are conceptual and empirical reasons to doubt that executive function should be defined in this way. I argue that the development of executive function is better understood as the emergence of skills in using control in the service of specific goals. Such goals activate and are influenced by mental content such as knowledge, beliefs, norms, values, and preferences that are acquired with development and are important to consider in understanding children’s performance on measures of executive function. This account better explains empirical findings than the component-process view; leads to specific, testable hypotheses; and has implications for theory, measurement, and interventions.},

Whilst such ‘gaze aversion’ (GA) is used far less by 5-year-old schoolchildren, its use increases dramatically during the first years of primary education, reaching adult levels by 8 years of age (Doherty-Sneddon, Bruce, Bonner, Longbotham, \& Doyle, 2002). The current study investigates whether developmental changes also occur in a qualitative aspect of GA – the direction of movement involved in GA shifts. Video data from eighteen 5-year-olds and nineteen 8-year-olds answering verbal and arithmetic questions were analysed for direction of GA. We found very different profiles of direction of GA across the two ages: whilst the 5-year-olds used predominantly rapid multidirectional ‘flicking’ movements and some sustained left lateral movements, the 8-year-olds used predominantly sustained rightward movements. It is concluded that there are concomitant qualitative changes in the nature of GA shifts as well as quantitative increases in the use of GA across these age groups. A model of human attention in face-to-face interaction is discussed, as are implications for the assessment of children's learning and development.}

  abstract = {Children's comprehension of the Hindu-Arabic number system was explored in relation to their ability to match spoken to Hindu-Arabic numerals. The possible involvement of verbal processes in numeric understanding was examined by comparing a group of 8-year olds with specific language impairments (SLI group, N = 13) to two control groups, the first matched for age and non-verbal ability (AC group, N = 13), the second younger group matched for language comprehension level (LC group, N = 12). SLI, AC and LC children's accuracy and efficiency in choosing the greater of two single-digit Hindu-Arabic numerals were compared. One child from the SLI group and three from the LC group failed to reach accuracy criterion. For accurate responders there was no difference between SLI and AC groups in latency to judge: both responded faster than the LC group. When making judgments all groups showed the Symbolic Distance Effect observed by Moyer \& Landauer (1967). All participants were able to match spoken numerals to Hindu-Arabic single-digit numerals without error. SLI and AC groups were tested on double digits. Accuracy and efficiency in judging the greater of two Hindu-Arabic double-digit numerals were tested. Ability to match spoken numerals to corresponding double-digit Hindu-Arabic numerals was also tested. All of 12 AC participants accurately matched spoken to Hindu-Arabic symbols, but 2 of these were unable to judge accurately the greater of pairs of HinduArabic symbols. Of 13 SLI children tested, 9 accurately matched spoken to Hindu-Arabic symbols; 2 of these were unable to judge Hindu-Arabic symbols accurately. One further child was able to judge accurately but performed poorly when matching spoken to Hindu-Arabic numerals. When school experience of doubledigit numbers was statistically controlled, there was no difference between SLI and AC groups in the accuracy of double-digit judgments. No difference was found between SLI and AC groups in the speed or pattern of accurate responders’ doubledigit judgments. When group data was pooled and school experience statistically controlled, accuracy in double-digit judgment was predicted by non-verbal ability, but not by expressive or receptive language skills. The pattern of responses to the double-digit judgments suggested a ‘holistic’ processing mechanism within which ‘transparent’ stimuli (those double digits which minimize conflict between ‘face’ and ‘place’ values) are most rapidly encoded. Whereas the ability to match verbal labels to Hindu-Arabic numerals appears generally to precede single- and double-digit comprehension, findings suggest that, especially in the acquisition of place-value knowledge, there is substantial autonomy of non-verbal systems.}

  abstract = {Research suggests that children's conceptual understanding of multiplication and division is weak and that it remains poor well into the later elementary school years. Further, children's understanding of fundamental concepts such as inversion and associativity does not improve as they progress from grades 6 to 8. Instead, some children simply possess strong understanding while others do not. Other studies have identified an increase across these grades. The present investigation analyses data from seven studies of Grade 6 (n = 226), Grade 7 (n = 221), and Grade 8 (n = 216) children's three-term problem-solving (e.g., 3 × 24 ÷ 24 and 3 × 24 ÷ 6) and provides a unified account of multiplication and division understanding, one in which grade differences and individual variability coexist and are moderated by sex. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Children's conceptual understanding of multiplication and division is weak and it is unclear whether it increases across the key grades of 6–8. Understanding of the inversion and associativity concepts is characterized by high individual variability, but grade and sex have never been found to be a contributing factor. What does this study add? A meta-analysis of seven data sets (n = 643) indicates that grade differences and individual variability coexist and are moderated by sex. Understanding increases across grade only for boys, but an equal number of boys and girls are in the top 10\% of conceptual problem-solvers.},

Overall, measures demonstrated moderate convergence (rrandom=.27 [95\% CI=.24, .30]; rfixed=.34 [.33,.35], k=282 samples, N=33,564 participants), although there was substantial heterogeneity in the observed correlations. Correlations within and across types of self-control measures were strongest for informant-report questionnaires and weakest for executive function tasks. Questionnaires assessing sensation seeking impulses could be distinguished from questionnaires assessing processes of impulse regulation. We conclude that self-control is a coherent but multidimensional construct best assessed using multiple methods.},

We tested whether childhood SES (income‐to‐needs ratio averaged across ages 9, 13, and 17) is prospectively associated with cortical surface morphometry in adulthood. Average childhood income‐to‐needs ratio had a positive, prospective association with cortical thickness in adulthood in the precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and caudal middle frontal gyrus (               p               ~{$<~$}.05, FWE corrected).

Concurrent income‐to‐needs ratio (measured at age 24) was not associated with cortical thickness or surface area in adulthood.

Forty-four children and their parents were observed carrying out a communication task (the Map Task), and were covertly filmed crossing roads around a university campus. The Map Task provided measures of task focus and sensitivity to another's current knowledge, which we predicted would be reflected in road-crossing behaviour. We modelled indices of road behaviour with factor scores derived from a principal-component analysis of communication features, and background variables including the age, sex and traffic experience of the child, and parental education. A number of variables were significantly related to road crossing, including the age and sex of the child, the length of the conversation, and specific conversational features such as the checking and clarification of uncertain information by both parent and child. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.}

  abstract = {Depicting space and volume in drawings is challenging for young children in particular. It has been assumed that several cognitive skills may contribute to children's drawing. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between perspective-taking skills in complex scenes and the spatial characteristics in drawings of 5- to 9-year-olds (N= 121). Perspective taking was assessed by two tasks: (a) a visual task similar to the three-mountains task, in which the children had to select a three-dimensional model that showed the view on a scene from particular perspective and (b) a spatial construction task, in which children had to plastically reconstruct a three-dimensional scene as it would appear from a new point of view. In the drawing task, the children were asked to depict a three-dimensional scene exactly as it looked like from their own point of view. Several spatial features in the drawings were coded. The results suggested that children's spatial drawing and their perspective-taking skills were related. The axes system and the spatial relations between objects in the drawings in particular were predicted, beyond age, by certain measures of the two perspective-taking tasks. The results are discussed in the light of particular demands that might underlay both perspective taking and spatial drawing.}

Progress is hamstrung by siloed scientific traditions and a focus on explanation over prediction, two issues that are particularly damaging for the study of multifaceted constructs like self-regulation. Here, we derive a psychological ontology from a study of individual differences across a broad range of behavioral tasks, self-report surveys, and self-reported real-world outcomes associated with self-regulation. Though both tasks and surveys putatively measure self-regulation, they show little empirical relationship. Within tasks and surveys, however, the ontology identifies reliable individual traits and reveals opportunities for theoretic synthesis. We then evaluate predictive power of the psychological measurements and find that while surveys modestly and heterogeneously predict real-world outcomes, tasks largely do not. We conclude that self-regulation lacks coherence as a construct, and that data-driven ontologies lay the groundwork for a cumulative psychological science.},

  abstract = {A specific deficit in theory of mind has been proposed to explain the distinct pattern of social/cognitive deficits in autistic individuals (Frith, 1989). However, it is clear that a number of children are able to demonstrate knowledge of mental states in others (Prior, Dahlstrom \& Squires, 1990), hence an important question is what particularly characterizes those autistic children who do show theory of mind. Baron-Cohen (1988) has argued that pragmatic language skills and theory of mind ability ought to be intimately related since they draw on similar representational abilities. We examined the cognitive linguistic correlates of this ability in 29 high functioning autistic children. The 11 children who could reliably show this ability were compared with those who could not, on CA, verbal MA, pragmatic language skills, WISC Vocabulary, Comprehension and Similarities, and were superior on all measures except Vocab and CA. A stepwise discriminant function analysis showed an 86 per cent correct classification of the two groups with pragmatic skills and abstract thinking as the best discriminators. Procedural and instructional variables were also assessed in this study, as was reliability of theory of mind ability from one year to the next. Most children were stable in their demonstrated knowledge. The addition of the word ‘first’ to the false belief question (Where will Sally first look for the marble?) allowed 50 per cent of the originally failing group to answer the question correctly, suggesting the need for extreme care in the details of replication experiments of this kind. Our results support the likelihood of a developmental delay in theory of mind in autism rather than endorsing the notion that this is a specific deficit with pervasive explanatory power. However, the findings might also support the ‘continuum’ conceptualization of autism with more mildly autistic children able to demonstrate knowledge of mental states and to develop adequate pragmatic language competence.}

  abstract = {It has been widely assumed that computing how a scene looks from another perspective (level-2 perspective taking, PT) is an effortful process, as opposed to the automatic capacity of tracking visual access to objects (level-1 PT). Recently, adults have been found to compute both forms of visual perspectives in a quick but context-sensitive way, indicating that the two functions share more features than previously assumed. However, the developmental literature still shows the dissociation between automatic level-1 and effortful level-2 PT. In the current paper, we report an experiment showing that in a minimally social situation, participating in a number verification task with an adult confederate, eight- to 9.5-year-old children demonstrate similar online level-2 PT capacities as adults. Future studies need to address whether online PT shows selectivity in children as well and develop paradigms that are adequate to test preschoolers’ online level-2 PT abilities. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject? Adults can access how objects appear to others (level-2 perspective) spontaneously and online Online level-1, but not level-2 perspective taking (PT) has been documented in school-aged children What the present study adds? Eight- to 9.5-year-olds performed a number verification task with a confederate who had the same task Children showed similar perspective interference as adults, indicating spontaneous level-2 PT Not only agent-object relations but also object appearances are computed online by eight- to 9.5-year-olds},

We designed new cognitive tasks within a detection paradigm adapted to preschoolers and attitudinal tasks that were presented as games in a computer screen. Participants were 75 majority-group children of 3, 4, and 5 years of age. Children's preferences and positive/negative attitudes towards the in-group (Spaniards) and three out-groups (Latin-Americans, Africans, and Asians) were measured. The results showed a remarkable preference and positivity for the in-group, but not out-group derogation. Children's cognitive performance, to a greater extent than their age, was positively associated with in-group favouritism and positivity. On the other hand, we found some interesting differences and developmental changes in children's positive orientation to the out-groups that are discussed in the last section.}

London, UK: Anna Freud Centre – University College London), a measure designed to assess reflective functioning (RF) or mentalization during middle childhood. Participants were 94 mother–child dyads divided into two subgroups; 46 dyads where children had histories of intrafamilial (n = 22 dyads) or extrafamilial (n = 24 dyads) sexual abuse, and a community control group composed of 48 mother–child dyads. RF of children and their mothers was assessed using videotaped and transcribed data gathered using the Child Attachment Interview and the Parent Development Interview (PDI: Slade, Aber, Bresi, Berger, \& Kaplan, 2004, The parent development interview-Revised. New York, NY: The City University of New York). The findings indicate that the CRFS proved reliable, with excellent intraclass correlation coefficients for general RF, as well as RF regarding self and others. Significant differences in RF were found between sexually abused children and the control group, and also between children who had experienced intrafamilial and extrafamilial sexual abuse. This provides support for the discriminant validity of the CRFS. Furthermore, maternal RF was associated with child RF. Both abuse and maternal RF made significant contributions to predicting children's RF regarding themselves, but child sexual abuse was the only variable that made a significant contribution to explaining variance in children's RF regarding others.},

  abstract = {Recent research has provided evidence for a substantial impact of children's peer status on positive and adaptive development. The current study investigated how 3- to 7-year-old preschoolers’ (N = 118) sharing behaviour and sharing expectations towards a friend and a non-friend relate to their popularity among their peers. Children distributed resources between themselves and a friend as well as themselves and a non-friend and predicted another protagonist's behaviour in the same situation. In addition, teachers rated children's problematic behaviour and peers rated children's peer status. Multilevel analysis revealed that preschoolers’ sharing expectations towards their friends but not sharing behaviour predicted their peer status above and beyond the impact of problematic behaviour. Age did not emerge as an independent predictor. These findings suggest that knowledge about prosociality in the form of sharing expectations is an important aspect in children's adaptive social development and stress the relevance of children's knowledge about the social world for their social life. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Prosocial behaviour in general relates positively to peer status. Problem behaviour relates negatively to peer status. Sharing behaviour and sharing expectations become more selective over the preschool years. What does this study add? Sharing expectations and to a lesser extent sharing behaviour relate to peer status. Sharing expectations predict peer status above and beyond the impact of problem behaviour. Differential sharing expectations predict peer status as well as simple sharing expectations.},

Using a time sampling method, observations of children in classroom settings were conducted twice during the preschool year. Repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance revealed that: (1) children were involved most in parallel play activities, and the amount of parallel play increased across the year; and (2) associative and cooperative play decreased. This pattern of behavioral change was present in 15 of the 22 classrooms. Conditional probability analyses indicated that associative play was an important context for verbalizations directed to both teachers and peers. At the time of each observation children played and talked with their peers most. We obtained one interaction effect between gender and time—the amount of talk from girls to teachers increased over the school year, whereas boys talked less to teachers over time. Classrooms were staffed by a certified teacher and an assistant and uniformly rated quite high on the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale. This research demonstrates that public school preschools are funded and staffed appropriately, but that more attention could be paid to facilitating play and verbal interactions that might be important for later school success. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

  abstract = {Patterns of problem-solving among 5-to-7 year-olds' were examined on a range of literacy (reading and spelling) and arithmetic-based (addition and subtraction) problem-solving tasks using verbal self-reports to monitor strategy choice. The results showed higher levels of variability in the children's strategy choice across Years 1 and 2 on the arithmetic (addition and subtraction) than literacy-based tasks (reading and spelling). However, across all four tasks, the children showed a tendency to move from less sophisticated procedural-based strategies, which included phonological strategies for reading and spelling and counting-all and finger modelling for addition and subtraction, to more efficient retrieval methods from Years 1 to 2. Distinct patterns in children's problem-solving skill were identified on the literacy and arithmetic tasks using two separate cluster analyses. There was a strong association between these two profiles showing that those children with more advanced problem-solving skills on the arithmetic tasks also showed more advanced profiles on the literacy tasks. The results highlight how different-aged children show flexibility in their use of problem-solving strategies across literacy and arithmetical contexts and reinforce the importance of studying variations in children's problem-solving skill across different educational contexts.}

White children favoured their in-group over the Black and Roma out-groups on the SSS measure, social preferences and positive as well as negative trait attributions. Generally, the Black and Roma showed equal SSS, preferences and trait attribution for their in-group and the high status White out-group, but not the other low-status out-group. With age White children generally demonstrated higher SSS for Black and Roma, preferred them more and attributed more positive traits. For low-status groups, an age effect was found only for Black children who preferred the Roma more with age and attributed more positive traits. Changes on preferences and trait attribution depending on age-group were mediated by SSS. It is concluded that minority group's SSS does not parallel the objective status hierarchy but, rather, is a dynamic reorganisation of group's relative positions serving strategies to cope with their minority condition.},

  abstract = {According to the attention network approach, attention is best understood in terms of three functionally and neuroanatomically distinct networks – alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Recent findings showed that social information influences the efficiency of these networks in adults. Using some social and non-social variants of the Attentional Network Test (ANT), this study was aimed to evaluate the development of the three attention networks in childhood, also assessing the development of the ability to manage social or non-social conflicting information. Sixty-six children (three groups of 6, 8, and 10 years of age) performed three variants of the original ANT, using fish, schematic, or real faces looking to the left or right as target and flanker stimuli. Results showed an improvement from 6 to 8 and 10 years of age in reaction time (RT) and accuracy, together with an improvement of executive control and a decrement in alerting. These developmental changes were not unique to social stimuli, and no differences were observed between social and no-social variants of the ANT. However, independently from the age of the children, a real face positively affected the executive control (as indexed by RTs) as compared to both a schematic face and a fish. Findings of this study suggest that attentional networks are still developing from 6 to 10 years of age and underline the importance of face information in modulating the efficiency of executive control. Statement of contribution What is already known? Younger children made more errors and slower reaction times (RTs) than older children, in line with the majority of the past selective attention studies. Younger children showed both greater conflict and alerting effect than older children. The prediction that younger children would display larger interference effects than older children was supported. What does this study add? Extending the findings observed in adults and children, independently from their age, demonstrated greater cognitive interference (i.e., slower RTs and higher percentage of errors to incongruent relative to congruent conditions) when fish and schematic faces were presented than when photographs of real faces were used as stimuli. Like adults, children have a greater ability in the control of social information as compared to non-social information. These results seem to indicate that the ability to handle social conflicts proceeds in parallel with the ability to manage non-social conflicting information.},

This competence seems particularly important in the current digital age in which children need to discern valid from invalid assertions about the world in both real-life and virtual interactions to ultimately gather and accumulate robust knowledge. We investigated whether younger and older preschoolers (N = 48) understand that a speaker's knowledge claim (‘I know where X is’) may be correct or incorrect given objectively accessible information (about whether the speaker had perceptual access to a critical event). We found that both younger and older preschoolers accepted correct knowledge claims that matched observable reality, but that only older preschoolers reliably rejected incorrect knowledge claims that did not match reality (the speaker lacked perceptual access). Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of younger preschoolers both rejected incorrect knowledge claims and gave valid explanations, suggesting that the ability to scrutinize epistemic claims develops gradually from around 3 to 4 years of age. These findings may help integrate research on children's norm and theory of mind development. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Preschoolers understand that non-epistemic claims (e.g., ‘This is an X!’) may be correct or incorrect, and they track a speaker's relevant characteristics in testimonial situations. It is not known what preschoolers understand about the validity of epistemic (knowledge) claims (e.g., ‘I know that X’). What does this study add? Younger and older preschoolers accepted correct knowledge claims (children observed that a speaker saw a critical event and was thus knowledgeable). Only older preschoolers reliably rejected incorrect knowledge claims (the speaker did not see the critical event). Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of younger preschoolers showed competence in their evaluation of, and reasoning about, incorrect knowledge claims. Findings suggest that the ability to evaluate epistemic claims develops gradually from around 3 to 4 years of age.},

Patterns of gaze, affect, proximity, touch, and parental teaching strategies were coded. Child self-regulation was observed at child care locations. Among Israeli families, interactions involved face-to-face exchange, social gaze, object focus, and active touch in infancy and indirect parental assistance to toddlers. Among Palestinian families, interactions consisted of continuous contact, neutral affect, reduced negative emotionality, and concrete assistance. Levels of self-regulation were comparable and were predicted by culture-specific patterns. Social gaze, touch, and indirect teaching were found to predict self-regulation among Israeli toddlers; contact and concrete assistance were predictors among Palestinians.

In theory, developing a theory of mind (ToM) should help children gain mutual friends and one preschool study (Peterson \& Siegal, 2002. Br J Dev Psychol, 20, 205) suggested a cross-sectional connection. We therefore used a 2-year prospective longitudinal design to explore ToM as a predictor of mutual friendship in 114 children from age 5 to 7 years after controlling potential confounds including language ability and group popularity. Confirming friendship's distinctiveness from group sociometric status, numerous group-rejected children (53\%) had a mutual friend whereas 23\% of those highest in group status did not. Five-year-olds with a mutual friend significantly outperformed their friendless peers on a comprehensive ToM battery (basic and advanced false belief). Longitudinally, chronically friendless 7-year-olds (no friends at either testing time) stood out for their exceptionally poor Time 1 ToM understanding even after controlling for group popularity, age, and language skill. Extending previous evidence of ToM's predictive links with later social and cognitive outcomes, these results for mutual friendship suggest possible interventions to help reduce the lifelong mental health costs of chronic friendlessness.},

  abstract = {Individual differences in early language skills have been found to be associated with other cognitive outcomes in childhood and adolescence. However, research is limited on whether these associations persist into adulthood. In this study, we examined potential associations of the timing of early language milestones with cognitive ability in a prospective cohort study of 938 singletons from the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort (CPC), who participated in a 50-year follow-up examination in 2009–2011. Later attainment of a number of milestones was associated with lower midlife IQ with the strongest associations found for ‘Naming objects/animals in pictures’, ‘Forming a sentence’, and ‘Sharing experiences’. Milestones related to language explained 6.7\% of the variance in midlife IQ, while milestones related to social interaction explained 3.1\%. The study provides evidence that individual differences in language development during the first years of life are associated with intelligence in midlife. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Differences in early language skills are associated with other cognitive skills in childhood and adolescence. No study has examined this association from childhood through midlife in a large community-based sample. What does this study add? Early language development is associated with intelligence in midlife. A total of 6.7\% of the variance in midlife IQ is explained by milestones related to language. Adjustment for potentially confounding factors did not change the associations.},

  abstract = {Between 12- and 14 months of age infants begin to use another's direction of gaze and affective expression in learning about various objects and events. What is not well understood is how long infants' behaviour towards a previously unfamiliar object continues to be influenced following their participation in circumstances of social referencing. In this experiment, we examined infants' sensitivity to an adult's direction of gaze and their visual preference for one of two objects following a 5-min, 1-day, or 1-month delay. Ninety-six 12-month-olds participated. For half of the infants during habituation (i.e., familiarization), the adults' direction of gaze was directed towards an unfamiliar object (look condition). For the remaining half of the infants during habituation, the adults' direction of gaze was directed away from the unfamiliar object (look-away condition). All infants were habituated to two events. One event consisted of an adult looking towards (look condition) or away from (look-away condition) an object while facially and vocally conveying a positive affective expression. The second event consisted of the same adult looking towards or away from a different object while conveying a disgusted affective expression. Following the habituation phase and a 5-min, 1-day, or 1-month delay, infants' visual preference was assessed. During the visual preference phase, infants saw the two objects side by side where the adult conveying the affective expression was not visible. Results of the visual preference phase indicate that infants in the look condition showed a significant preference for object previously paired with the positive affect following a 5-min and 1-day delay. No significant visual preference was found in the look condition following a 1-month delay. No significant preferences were found at any retention interval in the look-away condition. Results are discussed in terms of early learning, social referencing, and early memory.}

We were interested in verifying the hypothesis that memory is a specific contributor to listening comprehension in preschool children after controlling for verbal abilities. We were also interested in analyzing the developmental path of the relationship between memory skills and listening comprehension in the age range considered. Forty-four, 4-year-olds (mean age = 4 years and 6 months, SD =4 months) and 40, 5-year-olds (mean age = 5 years and 4 months, SD =5 months) participated in the study. The children were administered measures to evaluate listening comprehension ability (story comprehension), short-term and working memory skills (forward and backward word span), verbal intelligence and receptive vocabulary. Results showed that both short-term and working memory predicted unique and independent variance in listening comprehension after controlling for verbal abilities, with working memory explaining additional variance over and above short-term memory. The predictive power of memory skills was stable in the age range considered. Results also confirm a strong relation between verbal abilities and listening comprehension in 4- and 5-year-old children.}

The sample was 12,514 children from the UK's Millennium Cohort Study, followed at ages 3, 5, 7, and 11 years. Decision-making (risk-taking, quality of decision-making, risk adjustment, deliberation time, and delay aversion) was measured with the Cambridge Gambling Task. Even after adjustment for confounding, intelligence was positively associated with risk adjustment and quality of decision-making in both boys and girls. Furthermore, in girls risk adjustment was related positively to IQ gains. Our findings suggest that there are important, substantively, associations between intelligence and adapting behaviour to risk at the cusp of adolescence, the period when the response to risk can shape life trajectories. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject In children, intelligence and decision-making, measured with gambling tasks, are inconsistently linked. This could be due to gambling tasks not separating risk-taking from contingency-learning. What the present study adds This study measured 11-year-olds’ decision-making using a gambling task in which probabilities of different outcomes are presented explicitly. IQ was positively associated with risk adjustment and quality of decision-making. Also significant were IQ gains (for risk adjustment, only in girls). There are links between intelligence and adapting behaviour to statistical risk in children.},

Children (N = 78; Age M = 9.36) completed assessments of VSM, arithmetic strategies, and arithmetic accuracy. Consistent with previous findings, VSM predicted arithmetic accuracy in children. Extending previous findings, the current study showed that the relation between VSM and arithmetic performance was mediated by the frequency of children's use of decomposition strategies. Identifying the role of arithmetic strategies in this relation has implications for increasing the math performance of children with lower VSM. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The link between children's visuospatial working memory and arithmetic accuracy is well documented. Frequency of decomposition strategy use is positively related to children's arithmetic accuracy. Children's spatial skill positively predicts the frequency with which they use decomposition. What does this study add? Short-term visuospatial memory (VSM) positively relates to the frequency of children's decomposition use. Decomposition use mediates the relation between short-term VSM and arithmetic accuracy. Children with limited short-term VSM may struggle to use decomposition, decreasing accuracy.},

The identity of the person performing actions (self vs. other), as well as the identity of the person imagined (self vs. other) were varied to create four kinds of performhagine conditions. Results showed that 6-year-olds performed worse than adults in all four conditions, and they were more likely than adults to claim an imagined action was actually performed (Expt 1). This bias to claim an imagined action was performed was more pronounced for children who imagined themselves going through the motions of performing actions compared to those who imagined seeing themselves (Expt 2). Action similarity played a role in source monitoring, but only under some conditions. The results point to the importance of prospective processing for children's source monitoring, and suggest that systematic investigation of the goal-directed nature of actions in source monitoring is needed.}

Results confirmed that children's ability to accurately predict drivers' intentions improves with age and that sensitizing children through training to the options for action available to drivers when signalling a manoeuvre improves their accuracy in predicting drivers' intentions. Training was also found to shift children's focus from contextual infrastructural features of the traffic environment (e.g. traffic signals, stop signs) by which to judge drivers' likely intentions to the explicit cues that drivers use to signal their imminent actions (e.g. slowing down, moving into the kerb). Training on the simulation was also shown to transfer to practical decision making at the roadside.}

Testing 5-to 7-year-olds (n = 39), we aimed to shed light on the SRE by examining the memorial advantage for self-relevant information as a function of general ability, theory of mind, empathy, and recollection. Playing in pairs, children were presented with an array of pictures and took turns to select pictures (agency) and turn them over to reveal to whom they belonged (ownership). Later, they viewed the studied pictures intermixed with new ones and provided recognition- and source memory judgements. There was a robust SRE in recognition memory, mainly for agency, which varied positively with intellectual ability but negatively with theory of mind, empathy, and recollection. These findings accord with claims that self-referential information benefits from elaboration handled by domain-general processes, with the SRE counteracted by social processes that increase attention to other people.

Participants were asked to draw a series of objects and their depictions were scored for the incidence of intellectual realism. The tasks sought evidence of conceptual as opposed to episodic influences on intellectual realism in terms of (1) omission errors for the visible decorative attributes of isolated objects and (2) commission errors for the hidden categorical attributes of contextually situated objects. All groups evinced sensitivity to meaning as gauged by the former measure but the autistic group were impaired in their performance on the latter measure. Whereas children without autism were less likely to depict the occluded handle of a cup when the model was presented in context rather than independently, this trend was lacking in the autistic sample. We consider these findings in terms of weak central coherence and alternative accounts of impaired conceptualization in autism.}

Half of the subjects in each age group overtly named the pictures at presentation and the others remained silent. For suppression subjects who named the pictures these two tasks were performed concurrently. It was hypothesized that the effects of phonemic similarity would be affected by age and speech. This was supported, with older children showing a greater effect of phonemic similarity and subjects scoring more when allowed to overtly name the items. It was also hypothesized that the youngest children would benefit most from the overt naming of items. Analysis of the results indicated that the overt naming of items facilitated phonological recoding amongst the younger children, thereby supporting this hypothesis. The possibility that these results are due to the maturation of a phonemic store prior to the development of subvocal rehearsal processes is discussed.}

Specifically, we investigated whether cognitive inhibition, emotion regulation, emotionality, and disorganized attachment made independent and specific contributions to these externalizing behaviour problems from a multiple pathways perspective. The study included laboratory measures of cognitive inhibition and disorganized attachment in 184 typically developing children (M age = 6 years, 10 months, SD = 1.7). Parental ratings provided measures of emotion regulation, emotionality, and externalizing behaviour problems. Results revealed that cognitive inhibition, regulation of positive emotion, and positive emotionality were independently and specifically related to ADHD symptoms. Disorganized attachment and negative emotionality formed independent and specific relations to conduct problems. Our findings support the multiple pathways perspective on ADHD, with poor regulation of positive emotion and high positive emotionality making distinct contributions to ADHD symptoms. More specifically, our results support the proposal of a temperamentally based pathway to ADHD symptoms. The findings also indicate that disorganized attachment and negative emotionality constitute pathways specific to conduct problems rather than to ADHD symptoms.},

Parent-reported externalizing behaviour and ADHD symptoms were obtained when the participants were 8–9 and 13–14 years old. Personality and behavioural aspects of the psychopathic personality constellation were measured with self-report questionnaires when the participants were 16–17 years old. Persistent externalizing behaviour in childhood was associated with both psychopathic personality and antisocial behaviour in adolescence. However, within twin-pair analyses showed that genetic factors explained the association between persistent externalizing behaviour and psychopathic personality, while shared environmental factors explained the association between persistent externalizing and antisocial behaviours. We conclude that persistent externalizing behaviour is a genetically influenced precursor of psychopathic personality among boys.}

The default academic response to this pattern is often the deficit model: Poverty damages or impairs brain function, which leads to poor performance that only exacerbates the poverty. Deficits and damage are real phenomena. However, there are also other processes: People living in poverty may have made reasonable psychological responses to their circumstances or may have developed strengths that enhance their ability to cope with challenges in their lives. We illustrate these points by discussing the linked examples of time preference, early reproduction, and hidden talents. We argue for a balanced approach to the psychology of poverty that integrates deficit and strengths-based models. Future research could focus on the ways in which impairment and adaptation interact.},

  abstract = {Young children are frequently inaccurate in a simultaneous alignment task in which a square has to be laid down in alignment with a spatially discontiguous square, or a diamond with a diamond. The size of the inaccuracy can be manipulated by providing congruent or incongruent contextual cues. Three new results are reported here. First, accuracy at aligning the context itself seemed to obey grossly similar rules to those governing alignment to targets within the context. Secondly, the major determinant of contextual effects seemed to operate at the level of organizing the response rather than at encoding the display. Thirdly, whilst congruent cues on the response plane aided performance, they did not when they were located in the stimulus plane. Two suggestions are made to explain these effects. Firstly, children do not distribute their available orientation-encoding resources economically when forming a mental representation of the stimulus; secondly, they attempt the simultaneous matching task by using a sequential strategy. The observed alignment error may be a product of their inefficient collation of evidence from the perceptual cues monitored during the two earlier stages of the sequential strategy.}

  abstract = {Preschoolers often fail a false-belief test. Competing explanations have been offered from two perspectives: the theory of mind and the theory of reasons for action. A concept which unifies the two has been overlooked—the concept of a ‘need to know’, whereby someone has a reason for directing actions to the goal of forming a mental representation. Current tests that present the actor as a passive information user rather than an active information collector might underestimate preschoolers' conception of psychology. In Expt 1, a theory of mind test presented a false belief as the outcome of an actor's plan of action involving her need to know something. Preschoolers showed 85 per cent success when the test took the form of hide-and-seek, whilst success in a standard false-belief test was 48 per cent. In Expts 2 and 4 it was found that success was not due to a low level heuristic: in the former, asking children to act out the plan of action gave 94 per cent success compared with 66 per cent from a modified standard task. Success from conventional verbal questioning was reliably lower. Further probes revealed flexibility; in a true-belief test children recognized that the actor's plan would succeed, and in an ignorance test (Expt 3) they showed understanding that the seeker would not know where to search. We suggest that traditional tests underestimate preschoolers in two ways. One is in neglecting practical intelligence in favour of verbal questioning. The other is in challenging them with tests which pose an inferential problem about the intentionality of the actor and thus disturb children's ‘intentional stance’. Traditional tests reveal an important limitation on preschoolers' use of a theory of mind but not an organizational gap in their construction of psychology.}

  abstract = {Quantitative aspects of the study of animal and human behaviour are increasingly relevant to test hypotheses and find empirical support for them. At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species-specific options or exact settings. BORIS is a free, open-source and multiplatform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g. simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time-budget or single or grouped observations automatically and present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioural features. The observation data and time-budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL and JSON). The observed events can be plotted and exported in various graphic formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS and PDF).},

  abstract = {The study explored the possibility that individuals' assessment of children's personality and behavioural functioning may reflect stereotypic perceptions involving more negative expectations of boys from father-headed as opposed to mother-headed single-parent families. These hypotheses were based upon the assumptions of the pre-emincnce of the maternal role in the parent-child relation. The objective was to determine whether stereotypic perceptions, if any, prevail equally or differentially among laypersons and trained professionals such as teachers and social workers. Consistent with the hypotheses, the findings showed that both laypersons and professionals had more negative expectations of boys from father- as opposed to mother-custody homes. Comparison of laypersons with the professional group of teachers and social workers combined showed no significant differences between the perceptions of these two groups of respondents. The teachers, however, had significantly fewer stereotypic negative perceptions of boys from father-headed families than laypersons and social workers. The implications of the findings are discussed for the welfare of the children and their single parents, and the training of professionals.}

Neuroimaging research has shown that somatosensory mechanisms are activated when adults observe another person or object being touched. In this study, we measured event-related potentials from 4- to 5-year-old children to investigate the development of the neural correlates of the observation of human and object touch. Participants were presented with video clips of an arm or a cylindrical object being touched. Touch versus non-touch effects were observed in the amplitudes of the LSW component (600–700 ms) measured from electrodes over somatosensory region. Additionally, human versus non-human stimulus effects were reflected in the amplitudes of the parietal–central N100 component, as well as in the latencies of the N170 component recorded from parietal-occipital electrodes in children, as in adults in a previous study using this same paradigm. These findings provide evidence that relatively mature tactile mirroring mechanisms are activated during the observation of touch in children, and further suggest the possibility that these mechanisms are not particularly slow in their development relative to other aspects of social cognition.},

This research examined the relations among affective ToM tasks and assessments of empathy, measured directly and via parent reports in 4- to 6-year-olds. Children (N = 117) completed: an Appearance-Reality Emotion Task, an adapted Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, an Affective Stories Task, and an empathy task. Parents reported on children’s ToM and empathy, and language was assessed using a Picture Vocabulary Test. Controlling for language, no relationships were found among affective ToM measures and children’s age was only related to the Affective Stories Task. Further, controlling for age, only parent-reported empathy was associated with the Appearance-Reality Emotion Task. Once vocabulary and age were controlled, measures of affective ToM are unrelated and different developmental patterns emerged across measures. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject Affective theory of mind is a distinct subcomponent of theory of mind that corresponds to an independent developmental mechanism. However, little research has been conducted on affective ToM, its developmental trajectory during the preschool years, its assessment, and its relationship with related constructs, such as empathy. What the present study adds Children’s performance on affective ToM tasks was unrelated once age and language abilities were accounted for. Thus, there is a need to examine affective ToM and its measurement more extensively to ensure we are effectively capturing this construct. This study was the first to establish a Preschool Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task that uses images of children and pictorial response options and an Affective Stories Task that captures age-related changes in affective ToM beyond language skills.},

Results showed that groups with learning disabilities had different visuospatial working memory problems and that children with NLD had particular difficulties in the backward recall of locations.

Participants included 658 emerging adults (M = 19.9, SD = 2.7, 65.5\% female) who completed surveys measuring responses to rejection, friendship closeness, and emotional maladjustment. Five clusters were identified: secure regulated (19\%), disorganized unregulated (21\%), anxious unregulated (16\%), emotive (21\%), and avoidant suppressor (22\%). Each group displayed unique patterns, with the secure regulated group reporting significantly less withdrawal, retribution, rumination, and emotional maladjustment, and the disorganized unregulated group reporting the poorest functioning across all indicators. Significant cluster × sex effects were also found for friendship closeness. These findings suggest the importance of considering attachment and ER, and implications for attachment theory and development are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Insecure attachment representations are a significant risk factor for poorer outcomes across development. Hyperactivating and deactivating strategies are maladaptive responses to coping with emotional threat. These strategies are an extension of the internal working model and positive correlates of poorer functioning. What does this study add? Previous studies have over-relied on variable-centred approaches to replicate findings of attachment theory. A person-centred approach allowing for the joint consideration of patterns of both attachment and ER strategies.

The relations of family socialization practices and temperament to the children’s emotion regulation skills were also examined. Ninety predominantly minority low-income preschoolers (46 boys) and their mothers participated. During visits to the children’s preschools, observers watched for expressions of anger and sadness, and recorded the causes of the displays and the children’s reactions. Mothers reported on their emotion socialization and discipline practices and their children’s temperament. Although the children expressed more anger than sadness, they used more constructive reactions in response to sadness and more non-constructive reactions in response to anger. Maternal reports of appropriate family emotion were associated with low levels of non-constructive regulation responses to anger and sadness whereas reports of inconsistent parental discipline were generally associated with non-constructive regulation responses. All in all, the findings of this study are in accord with findings on middle-income children and indicate that low- and middle-income children are more alike than different with regard to the regulation of negative emotion in the peer environment.},

  abstract = {Children show understanding of a mistaken story character's actions in their visualorienting responses before they show this in their answers to test questions. Clements and Perner (1994) interpreted the visual responses as reflecting implicit understanding (implicit-knowledge hypothesis). The present study explores three possible ways of saving the hypothesis that different bodies of exclusively explicit knowledge are involved (explicit-knowledge-only hypothesis): the lack-of-confidence hypothesis asserts that children are just not confident of the novel but correct answer and the misinterpretation hypothesis claims that children are simply misinterpreting the test question. The temporal stacking hypothesis assumes that children consider first the novel idea that the protagonist will go where he or she thinks the object is and then they consider the more established idea that the protagonist will go where the object really is. It explains the original finding by assuming that visual responses are governed by the earlier and the verbal answers by the later considered idea. The results offered little support for the first two of these attempts to save the explicit-knowledge-only hypothesis. Although parts of the results are compatible with the temporal stacking hypothesis, the overall pattern of results is not. Rather, it is very similar to findings from implicit visual perception, where people experience a lack of conscious awareness. This similarity reinforces the original interpretation of a dissociation between implicit and explicit understanding of belief-based action.}

This article reviews the EF literature during the preschool period using an integrative framework. The framework adopted considers EF to be a unitary construct with partially dissociable components (A. Miyake et al., 2000). The authors focus on 3 EF components: working memory, response inhibition, and shifting. For the present purposes, the central executive is conceived of as a central attention system that is involved in all EF component operations. Research to date suggests that elementary forms of the core EF components are present early during the preschool period. Changes in EF during the latter half of the preschool period appear to be due to the development of attention and integration of component EFs. Finally, the review outlines a number of areas that warrant further investigation if researchers are to move forward in understanding early EF development.

Using a collaborative problem-solving paradigm, the communication patterns of pairs of 4- and 7-year-old children were analysed. It was found that collaborative problem solving facilitated lower ability children's subsequent individual problem solving when they were paired with higher ability children. In addition, it was found that older children used more language during collaboration. Holding number of utterances as a covariate, older children used more procedural language and more descriptive language than younger children and lower ability children used more language for checking with their partner. These uses of language were interpreted as demonstrating awareness on the part of older children of the other person in the collaboration although the extent to which this assisted subsequent problem-solving ability in less able children of either age is not clear and requires further theoretical explication.}

  abstract = {Three studies investigatedchildren's ability to drawinferences fromtheproperties of one mental state to the properties of another. Inferences from knowledge/ignorance to the possible contents of pretends and beliefs are crucial to developing a representational theory of mental states. In Experiment 1, we replicated Lillard's (1993) finding that 4- and 6-year-olds fail to appreciate that a character who does not know about an entity cannot pretend to be that entity. We show that these children also fail a similar task in which the inference to be made is from not knowing to thinking (false belief). Lillard's inference tasks may be difficult because of their performance demands—specifically, children are not offered a plausible alternative content for the agent's pretence or belief state. In a second experiment, children were presented with know-pretend and know-think inference tasks which offered two options for the content of a character's mental state. One option was consistent with that character's knowledge state, while the other was not. Under these conditions, 4- and 6-year-oldchildren's performance improved significantly on both pretend and think. A third experiment investigated the role of the salience of the character's ignorance and the possible use of an association strategy in producing successful performance in Experiment 2. When the salience of the character's ignorance was reduced, children still succeeded on know-pretend inferences but failed on know-think inferences. These results suggest that children do not really grasp the theory of mental representation. The results better support the ToMM-SP model of ‘theory of mind’ development. Accordingto this model, conceptpossession is prior to, and therefore does not depend upon, knowledge of theories, and task success depends upon the control of salience.}

These include distinctions in the underlying cognitive systems, processes, or representations involved in ToM, distinctions among methodologies or task procedures used to measure ToM, and distinctions among behavioural signatures evaluated as evidence for the engagement of ToM. We propose an approach in which rather than continued dispute over whether or not ToM ‘is’ or ‘is not’ automatic, researchers focus instead on discovering what the range of stimulus conditions and task contexts are that give rise to various signatures of the ToM system. These input–output relations will constrain theorizing about the kinds of representations employed, the types of processing operating over those representations, and the overall architecture of ToM mechanisms.}

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, different interventions were shown to be effective in changing cognitive performance in preschoolers from poor homes undertaking tasks with executive demands. However, this evidence also showed that not all children included in the intervention groups equally increased their performance levels, which could be related to individual and contextual variability. The present study aimed to explore the impact of a computerized cognitive training intervention with lab-based tasks in preschoolers from Unsatisfied Basic Needs (UBN) homes under the consideration of their baseline performance. In the context of a randomized controlled trial design, different interventions were administered to children according to their baseline performance in a variety of cognitive tasks (i.e., executive attention, inhibitory control, working memory, and planning demands). The results showed different patterns of impact on performance depending on the experimental group, supporting the importance of considering individual and contextual differences in the design of interventions aimed at optimizing executive functions in poverty-impacted sample populations in early stages of development.},

  abstract = {This study examines children's metaphonological awareness for accent-related information in connected speech. In the first experiment, 5- to 6-year-old French-speaking children were asked to discriminate between Southern and Northern accented French in a sentence categorization task. It was found that these children were not able to reliably distinguish between these native variations of their own language, but were able to distinguish between their own accent and a strong foreign accent in Experiment 2. These findings were also replicated using a speaker discrimination task in Experiment 3, where children were asked to detect pairs of speakers sharing the same accent amongst speaker pairs with different accents. Whilst these experiments have shown that 5- to 6-year-old children do not use non-familiar regional accents as a discriminatory cue, they are able to perceive the differences between accents, as demonstrated in the AX task used in Experiment 4. The factors underlying the relative lack of awareness for a regional accent as opposed to a foreign accent in childhood are discussed, especially regarding the amount of exposure and the learnability of both types of accents.}

However, few studies have simultaneously examined autonomic physiology and brain activity during cognitive tasks. Such research is promising for understanding how early adversity impacts neurocognitive development in children, given that stress experienced early in life impacts both autonomic function and regulatory behaviors. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) as a neural measure of auditory selective attention, and cardiovascular measures of high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) and preejection period (PEP), in 105 3–5-year-old children with varying degrees of socioeconomic risk. First, we replicated a previous study from our lab: Increased socioeconomic risk was associated with larger ERP amplitudes elicited by distracting sounds. Next, we tested whether PEP and HF-HRV (at rest and during the task) were associated with the distractor ERP response, and found that a physiological profile marked by heightened sympathetic nervous system activity, indexed by shorter PEP, was associated with better ERP suppression of distractor sounds in lower SES children. Finally, we found that PEP mediated the relationship between socioeconomic risk and larger ERP responses to distractor sounds. In line with similar reports, these results suggest that for lower SES children, there is a potential biological cost of achieving better cognitive performance, seen here as increased cardiovascular arousal both at rest and in response to task demands.

An integrated understanding of R\&S development requires a move away from the largely one-sided (nature-or-nurture) and additive (nature + nurture) accounts provided in the extant literature. R\&S development has been understood as an expression of evolved cognitive modules (nature) on the one hand, and of socialization and social learning (nurture) on the other, or in similar albeit additive terms (e.g., nature produces the brain/mind, culture fills in the details). We argue that humans’ evolved psychological predispositions are substantially co-shaped by environmental/cultural input, such as relational experiences and modelling at the microlevel through belief and value systems at the macrolevel. Nurture's sculpting of nature is, then, expressed in R\&S development. Finally, for heuristic purposes, we illustrate a fully integrated nature–nurture model with attachment theory and its application to R\&S development. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Development unfolds as a function of nature–nurture interaction. R\&S development has mostly been understood from the point of view of separate nature or nurture models. What does this study add? A collected consideration of the intricate interactions between nature and nurture in development. A sketch, examples, and a conceptual toolbox of how nature and nurture interact in R\&S development.},

However, it remains unclear how well RSA-W predicts adaptive functioning (AF) outcomes and whether certain caveats of measuring RSA (e.g., respiration) significantly impact these associations. A meta-analysis of 44 studies (n = 4996 children) revealed small effect sizes such that greater levels of RSA-W were related to fewer externalizing, internalizing, and cognitive/academic problems. In contrast, RSA-W was differentially related to children’s social problems according to sample type (community vs. clinical/at-risk). The relations between RSA-W and children’s AF outcomes were stronger among studies that co-varied baseline RSA and in Caucasian children (no effect was found for respiration). Children from clinical/atrisk samples displayed lower levels of baseline RSA and RSA-W compared to children from community samples. Theoretical/practical implications for the study of cardiac vagal control are discussed.},

This study investigated self-distancing in relation to individual differences in executive function (EF) and effortful control (EC). Typically developing 4- (n = 72) and 6-year-olds (n = 67) were randomly assigned to think about the self from one of four perspectives: self-immersed, control, third-person, or competent media character. Children participated in a frustrating task for up to 10 min and overt expressions of frustration were coded. Conceptually replicating prior research with adults, younger children, and children with lower EF and lower EC (independent of age) benefitted the most from self-distancing. This suggests self-distancing is especially effective during a frustrating task for children with less developed self-control, adding to a growing body of research showing self-distancing is especially effective for vulnerable individuals. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Using third-person speech and pretending to be a media character improve children's self-regulation. Age and theory of mind skills are related to the effectiveness of self-distancing. What does this study add? Self-distancing can help children regulate their emotions during an emotionally charged task.

This prepares the way for our presentation of the framework we use to organize the many different types of emotion regulation. Using this framework, we review findings from child developmental and adult literatures. In the last section, we highlight some of the biggest challenges--and opportunities--for those interested in emotion and emotion regulation.  Topics include: emotions and related processes (core features of emotion, the modal model of emotion), emotion regulation and related processes (core features of emotion regulation, emotion regulation and related constructs), emotion regulation strategies (situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, cognitive change, response modulation), and elaborations and complications (time and feedback, antecedent-focused versus response-focused regulation, from one process to many).

As this often relies on everyone's convergence on the same strategy (e.g., driving on the left side of the road), a common solution is to conform to majority behaviour. In this study, we presented 5-year-old children with a coordination problem: To retrieve some rewards, they had to choose the same of four options as a peer partner – in reality a stooge – whose decision they were unable to see. Before making a choice, they watched a video showing how other children from their partner's peer group had behaved; a majority chose the same option and a minority chose a different one. In a control condition, children watched the same video but could then retrieve the reward irrespective of their partner's choice (i.e., no coordination was necessary). Children followed the majority more often when coordination was required. Moreover, conformers mostly justified their choices by referring to the majority from the video demonstration. This study is the first to show that young children are able to strategically coordinate decisions with peers by conforming to the majority.},

Counterfactual reasoning accounted for limited unique variance in false belief.

Results demonstrated the importance of language and executive function for both counterfactual and false belief. Implications are discussed.}

Participants completed the Perceptions of Parents Scales for the parental support, the Dependency (DPC)- and Achievement (APC)-oriented Psychological Control Scales for the parental psychological control, and the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Child Form for the child's trait EI. Trait EI was related to parenting variables, and also, parental practices (both support and psychological control) predicted global trait EI in adolescents. Some gender-specific differences were found: both APC and DPC were negative predictors of trait EI in males, whereas only APC significantly predicted trait EI in females. Future longitudinal studies are needed to examine these results and to shed light on the processes involved in the development of trait EI. Statement of contribution What is already known on the subject? There exists strong evidence of the interaction between parenting practices and emotional development in children and adolescents. Therefore, parental psychological control is negatively correlated with peer support and self-esteem, and positively related to anxiety and aggressive behaviour in children. However, there is paucity on research examining the relationship between parenting and trait EI in children. What does this study adds? This study extends earlier work in this field and investigates whether there is a relationship between trait EI and parenting practices (parental support and psychological control) and whether it depends on child and parent gender. This study, therefore, aims to investigate, for the first time, parental factors that may, in addition to those constitutional, be related to trait EI in children. Specifically, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether parenting practices would predict adolescents’ trait EI and whether these relations depend on the gender.},

  abstract = {The first aim of the present study was to examine the structure of effortful control. The second aim was to determine whether components of effortful control relate to conduct problems and hyperactivity. Effortful control was measured in 3-year-old children (N= 89) with an observational measure, the effortful control battery (ECB), and a parent report, the Children's Behaviour Questionnaire (CBQ). Principal component analysis showed that the ECB measures five components, assessing two higher-order constructs, which can be labelled as Self-Control and Attention/Motor Control. The five scales of the CBQ appeared to measure one construct – a more general measure of effortful control. The components and constructs of the ECB as well as the scales of the CBQ were differently related to conduct problems and hyperactivity. Conduct problems were most strongly predicted by observed Delay of Gratification and parent-reported Inhibitory Control, whereas Hyperactivity was most strongly predicted by observed Delay of Gratification, and the higher-order construct Attention/Motor Control, as well as parent-reported Attentional Focusing and Inhibitory Control. It is important to keep in mind that effortful control is composed of heterogeneous components, all having their own unique values.}

Regarding course, early disparities would be expected to grow during development if caused by accumulating stressors at a given constant level of               SES               . Alternatively, they would narrow if schooling partly compensates for the effects of earlier deprivation, allowing lower‐               SES               children to ‘catch up’. The potential for later childhood               SES               change to affect               EF               is also unknown. Regarding mediating factors, previous analyses produced mixed answers, possibly due to correlation amongst candidate mediators. We address these issues with measures of               SES               , working memory and planning, along with multiple candidate mediators, from the               NICHD               Study of Early Childcare (               n               = 1009). Early family income‐to‐needs and maternal education predicted planning by first grade, and income‐to‐needs predicted working memory performance at 54 months. Effects of early               SES               remained consistent through middle childhood, indicating that the relation between early indicators of               SES               and               EF               emerges in childhood and persists without narrowing or widening across early and middle childhood. Changes in family income‐to‐needs were associated with significant changes in planning and trend‐level changes in working memory. Mediation analyses supported the role of early childhood home characteristics in explaining the association between               SES               and               EF               , while early childhood maternal sensitivity was specifically implicated in the association between maternal education and planning. Early emerging and persistent               SES               ‐related differences in               EF               , partially explained by characteristics of the home and family environment, are thus a potential source of socioeconomic disparities in achievement and health across development.                        ,              We examined the developmental course of socioeconomic disparities in executive function and the features of childhood experience responsible for this association in the NICHD Study of Early Childcare. Lower family socioeconomic status (SES) predicts worse performance on tasks of executive function at the youngest age measured for each task, which was partially explained by characteristics of the home and family environment. SES does not predict the rate of growth of executive function across early and middle childhood, and thus early SES differences in executive function persist without accumulating or diminishing.},

Here, we examine the relative importance of parents’ socio-economic status, mental health, and parenting as predictors of EF development, drawing on a large (n = 1,070) community sample of Norwegian children who received biennial EF assessments from 6 to 10 years of age. We measure EF by means of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. We assess parenting through observer ratings of parent–child interactions and parental mental health via the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and Hopkins Symptom Checklist. When we adjust for all time-invariant unmeasured confounders, higher parental education predicts superior EF development, whereas harsh parenting forecasts poorer EF development. However, parenting does not mediate the effect of parental education. These results indicate that harsh parenting should be targeted in interventions aimed at improving EF. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Parental factors seem to affect child development of executive functions (EF). Specifically, parental socio-economic status, mental health, and their parenting seem to influence the developmental course of child EF. What does this study add? To what degree the parental influence on EF development is likely to be driven by time-invariant factors, for example, genetics.

It cannot, however, explain the non-social impairments and skills shown by people with autism. Frith (1989) and Frith \& Happé (1994a) have suggested that these aspects of autism can, instead, be understood as manifestations of a characteristic of general information processing in autism: ‘weak central coherence’. The relationship between theory of mind deficits and weak coherence is examined in the present paper. Sixteen relatively able participants with autism, who differed in their theory of mind task performance, were tested with a homograph reading task, in which pronunciation of target words is determined by integration of whole sentence context (e.g. pronouncing tear in ‘In her eye/dress there was a big tear’). The results suggest that people with autism at all levels of theory of mind performance show a relative failure to process information for context-dependent meaning in this task. The implications of these findings for current theories of autism are discussed.}

In a quite separate diagnostic group—individuals with autism—social impairments have recently attracted a great deal of research, with the suggestion that children with autism lack a ‘theory of mind’. This hypothesis has been successful in explaining many of the social difficulties these individuals manifest, both in laboratory tests and in everyday life. The present study investigated whether the social impairments in conduct disorder might have a similar root. Standard false belief tasks and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS), with additional items specially designed to assess understanding of other minds in everyday life, were used with eight normally developing children and 18 children with conduct disorder. The VABS documented extensive and widespread social impairment in this clinical group. There was also evidence of impairment in social insight, not dissimilar to that found in able individuals with autism. Children with conduct disorder were markedly different from children with autism, however, in terms of type of maladaptive activity. They showed more antisocial behaviour and very little bizarre (e.g. stereotyped, self-stimulatory) behaviour. Implications for cognitive theories of social information processing in conduct disorder are discussed.}

The study proposes that interpretive theory of mind (iToM), which follows ToM attainment, underlies important shifts towards mature social understanding. With ToM found to predict the needs orientation in prosocial moral reasoning (PMR), we hypothesized that iToM, unlike ToM, would account for PMR orientations requiring empathic reasoning. Those with iToM recognize the role of subjective processes, such as interpretation, in knowing. They can invoke others’ subjective processes, not just their physical perspectives, in explaining others’ decisions. A study with 225 7- to 11-year-old children (Mage = 9.04, SD = 0.91) found that iToM, but not ToM, predicted empathic and internalized values PMR orientations when controlling for age, emotion understanding and inhibitory control. These findings show that iToM attainment plays a unique role in developing social understanding such as reflected in empathic reasoning-based PMR orientations.},

Nevertheless, children often show persistent fear of imaginary creatures, particularly monsters (Jersild, 1943). To find out what conception children have of such imaginary creatures, 4- and 6-year-olds were questioned about three types of item: real items (e.g. a cup), ordinary imagined items (e.g. an image of a cup) and supernatural imagined items (e.g. an image of a monster). In two experiments, both age groups sharply differentiated the real items from both types of imagined item. Despite this apparently firm grasp of the distinction between fantasy and reality, two further experiments showed that 4- and 6-year-olds are not always certain that a creature that they have imagined cannot become real. Having imagined a creature inside a box, they show apprehension or curiosity about what is inside the box, and often admit to wondering whether the creature is actually inside. The experiments suggest that children systematically distinguish fantasy from reality, but are tempted to believe in the existence of what they have merely imagined.}

  abstract = {Effective emotion regulation is essential for children’s positive development. Polyvagal theory provides a framework for understanding how parasympathetic regulation of cardiac activity contributes to children’s adaptive versus maladaptive functioning. Maintenance of cardiac respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) under social challenge should support emotion regulation and behavioral adjustment. Children’s effective parasympathetic regulation and behavioral adjustment should be supported by appropriate parental socialization. These proposals were evaluated in a short-term longitudinal study of 94 preschool-aged children. Parenting and basal RSA were measured at home, then 6–10 months later behavioral adjustment and RSA in lab baseline and socially challenging contexts were measured. Children with relatively higher RSA in social challenge than at baseline (DRSA) had fewer internalizing problems (IP) and externalizing problems (EP), and better behavioral self-regulation (SR). Mothers who used more negative control had children with lower DRSA, more IP and EP, and less SR. Structural equation modeling showed that vagal regulation mediated associations between maternal negative control and children’s adjustment; maternal negative control did not predict EP or SR after accounting for DRSA. Associations were consistent across boys and girls, with one exception: Higher DRSA was significantly associated with fewer EP in boys only. These findings suggest that the practical significance of physiological regulation might be best revealed in ecologically valid procedures, and that children’s physiological mechanisms of emotion regulation are shaped by their experiences of parental socialization.},

We tested the hypothesis that the gender difference is partly due to changing tactics in peer interaction. Observations of girls’ and boys’ social initiatives and reactions to opportunities for conflict were made, using the Peer Interaction Coding System (PICS) in four independent samples of children between 9 and 36 months of age, which were aggregated to form a summary data set (N= 323), divided into two age bands (below or above 24 months of age). Linear mixed-model analyses revealed significant age by gender interactions in the use of bodily force in response to peers’ initiatives and in the tendency to use bodily force at later stages of conflicts with peers. The gender difference in use of force was not explained by differences in the use of verbal tactics. These cross-sectional findings suggest that girls are initially more likely than boys to use reactive aggression, but then desist, whereas boys increase their use of force to defend their territory and possessions. The difference between older and younger girls likely reflects girls’ abilities to regulate their behaviour in response to social challenges and the fact that girls are explicitly socialized to yield to peers’ demands.}

In contrast to older populations, it is possible that young children may adopt the persona of attractive characters with whom they identify rather than comparing themselves to the characters.

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that infants and toddlers succeed at a wide range of non-elicited-response false-belief tasks (i.e., tasks that do not require children to answer a direct question about a mistaken agent's likely behaviour). However, one exception to this generalization comes from verbal anticipatory-looking tasks, which have produced inconsistent findings with toddlers. One possible explanation for these findings is that toddlers succeed when they correctly interpret the prompt as a self-addressed utterance (making the task a non-elicited-response task), but fail when they mistakenly interpret the prompt as a direct question (making the task an elicited-response task). Here, 2.5-year-old toddlers were tested in a verbal anticipatory-looking task that was designed to help them interpret the anticipatory prompt as a self-addressed utterance: the experimenter looked at the ceiling, chin in hand, during and after the prompt. Children gave evidence of false-belief understanding in this task, but failed when the experimenter looked at the child during and after the prompt. These results reinforce claims of robust continuity in early false-belief reasoning and provide additional support for the distinction between non-elicited- and elicited-response false-belief tasks. Three accounts of the discrepant results obtained with these tasks – and of early false-belief understanding more generally – are discussed.}

However, to date these interactions have only been examined cross-sectionally among inattentive and/or hyperactive/impulsive children. This study investigated the moderating effects of neuropsychological functioning at age 3–4 years on the relation between negative emotionality at age 3–4 years and global functioning 1 year later, at age 4–5 years. Hyperactive/inattentive (H/I; n = 114) preschoolers entered the study (BL: baseline) and were seen again 1 year later (F1). Children's BL scores on a neuropsychological test (NEPSY) and their temperament as rated by parents (Child Behavior Questionnaire) and teachers (Temperament Assessment Battery for Children-Revised) were obtained, as were clinicians’ ratings of their global functioning (Children's Global Assessment Scale) at F1. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed that BL temperament variables accounted for significant variance in F1 Global Functioning. Significant interactions indicated that higher Verbal Executive abilities were associated with better child functioning when parent-rated Effortful Control was high, but not when Effortful Control was low. Additionally, high levels of Nonverbal Executive skills were associated with higher child global functioning when both parent- and teacher-rated negative affect was low, but not when negative affect was high.},

Previous studies have mainly focused on the relationship between inhibition and regulation in the Don't context (e.g., inhibitory control), while few have investigated this relationship in the Do context (e.g., task persistence). This longitudinal study examined the effect of temperamental inhibition on behavioural regulation during both the Do and Don't contexts in 112 Chinese preschoolers. At 3.5 years of age, children's behavioural inhibition was assessed by behavioural observation and parental report, and then at 4.5 years of age, their regulatory behaviours were measured in the following two challenging contexts: Do [locked box (LB)] and Don't [toy inhibition (TI)]. In each task, children were randomly assigned to either a high- or a low-incentive condition designed to vary the value of a given goal. Results suggested that higher inhibition was associated with poorer regulation (lower task persistence) in both conditions of the Do context (LB), whereas in the Don't context (TI) highly inhibited children showed better regulation (less violation behaviours) in the low-incentive condition than they did in the high-incentive condition. The results highlight the context characteristics and goal incentive as important factors for behavioural regulation development in inhibited children in China.},

  abstract = {Two experiments test the hypothesis that articulatory rehearsal causes the increase in memory span with age. This is an important issue, because, according to the working memory model, children as young as 4 years use rehearsal in memory span tasks. The developmental improvement is argued to be in the speed of rehearsal with age. However, other developmental evidence suggests that the improvement in span is actually due to an increase in the use of rehearsal with age. As most of this evidence is based on visual, not auditory, presentation, two converging approaches were used to test whether rehearsal was implicated in the age-related increase in auditory memory span. Experiment 1 trained children aged 5, 7 and 9 years to rehearse, and Expt 2 prevented children aged 5–6 and 8–9 years from rehearsing. If rehearsal is the major factor in span development, training rehearsal should improve span in younger children more than in older children, whereas preventing rehearsal should reduce spans of older children to the level of those of younger children. In neither experiment did the effects of training or preventing rehearsal differ at different age levels. The results suggest that articulatory rehearsal is not a major factor in the development of auditory memory span up to the age of about 9 years.}

In the last decades, several intervention programs have been implemented to optimize the development of children living in poverty. Some of them had positive effects, and also allowed the identification of effectiveness principles. However, such approaches have not yet been integrated conceptually and methodologically with the intervention efforts proposed by Cognitive Neuroscience. Based on examples of interventions implemented by Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience, the present study analyzes some of the main aspects to be considered in such integration.

The main contribution of this study resides in the interdisciplinary development of the intervention, made in close collaboration between educational researchers, and researchers in cognitive neuroscience and developmental psychology. The intervention was implemented by teachers through class activities, to promote executive functions and academic achievement. These activities were articulated into the current kindergarten curriculum and, at the same time, built upon concepts and methodologies of developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience for executive functions training. Results showed: (1) non-significant differences between groups in cognitive performance from pre- to post-training assessment, and (2) significant differences in academic achievement for Language, Mathematics, Autonomy, and Contact with peers in first grade. Our study sets a precedent for future interdisciplinary work bridging the gap between developmental psychology and education, which we believe will prove key to improving academic success.},

Forty four 5-year-old children were evaluated with a processing speed task; individual and socioenvironmental information was obtained from parents’ interviews. Higher scores in the effortful control dimension of temperament were associated with higher performance in the processing speed task. No other individual or socioenvironmental variable predicted the performance.

A cross-sectional sample of 119 Dutch and 122 Flemish fourth to sixth graders solved a varied set of multidigit division problems. With latent class analysis, three distinct strategy profiles were identified: children consistently using number-based strategies, children combining the use of column-based and number-based strategies, and children combining the use of digit-based and number-based strategies. The relation between children's strategy profiles and their instructional setting (country) and grade were generally in line with instructional differences, but large individual differences remained. Furthermore, Dutch children more frequently made adaptive strategy choices and realistic solutions than their Flemish peers. These results complement and refine previous findings on children's strategy use in relation to mathematics instruction. Statement of contribution What is already known? Mathematics education reform emphasizes variety, adaptivity, and insight in arithmetic strategies. Countries have different instructional trajectories for multidigit division. Mixed results on the impact of instruction on children's strategy use in multidigit division. What does this study add? Latent class analysis identified three meaningful strategy profiles in children from grades 4–6. These strategy profiles substantially differed between children. Dutch and Flemish children's strategy use is related to their instructional trajectory.},

  abstract = {Direct observation is one of the most widely used assessment procedures by school psychologists. In a survey of more than 1,000 school psychology practitioners, Wilson and Reschly (1996) found that of the 26 different types of assessment instruments listed across seven different assessment categories (e.g., ability/intelligence, social/emotional, visual/motor), structured observational methods were ranked highest in terms of frequency of use. Overall, practitioners report that they conduct more than 15 behavioral observations of student behavior during the course of a typical month. Systematic direct observation refers to observation of behavior other than behavior that has been explicitly elicited by a predetermined and standardized set of stimuli (i.e., test behavior (Salvia \& Ysseldyke, 2001)). School psychology practitioners commonly use both naturalistic and systematic direct approaches to observing student behavior. Briefly, naturalistic observation approaches refer to those observational procedures where the observer enters specific situations (e.g., a classroom) and observes all that is going on with no predetermined behaviors in mind. Here, the most common way of recording observations is to keep an anecdotal record of the behaviors that seem important to the observer. In summarizing the information, the observer provides a complete description of the many behaviors and the context in which they occurred. In contrast, systematic direct approaches to behavioral observation are distinguished by five characteristics (Salvia \& Ysseldyke, 2001). First, the goal of observation is to measure specific behaviors. Second, the behaviors being observed have been operationally defined a priori in a precise manner. Third, observations are conducted under standardized procedures and are highly objective in nature. Fourth, the times and places for observation are carefully selected and specified. Fifth, scoring and summarizing of data are standardized and do not vary from one observer to another. Both naturalistic and systematic direct approaches to observing behavior have proven useful in developing theory and practice related to the assessment and intervention of student behavior. This chapter provides an overview of (a) naturalistic observational procedures, (b) systematic direct observational procedures, and (c) observational instruments as they related to the observation of student behavior in the classroom.

In different theoretical accounts, AR reflects the efficiency of an articulatory rehearsal loop, while IT reflects the availability of a central workspace. In the present study, IT and AR were compared as predictors of memory span for spoken words of one, two and three syllables in children aged 5, 8 and 11. The results showed that a linear function described the variation of span with both age and word-length but there was no equivalent relationship between span and IT. The sensitivity of span to word-length was much reduced when rehearsal was prevented by articulatory suppression. These findings suggest that variation of span with age and word-length is attributable to rehearsal rather than the availability of a central workspace. However, suppression did not reduce age differences in span, showing that developmental processes other than rehearsal are also important.}

  abstract = {Recent work on metacognition indicates that monitoring is sometimes based itself on the feedback from control operations. Evidence for this pattern has not only been shown in adults but also in elementary schoolchildren. To explore whether this finding can be generalized to a wide range of age groups, 160 participants from first to eighth grade participated in a study based on a self-paced study time (ST) allocation paradigm. In contrast to previous studies, picture pairs instead of word pairs were used as stimuli to compensate for reduced reading skills in younger participants. Actual ST and judgments of learning (JOLs) made at the end of each study trial were used as core variables. The results are in line with previous findings, in that children's JOLs decreased with increasing ST, suggesting that JOLs were based on the memorizing effort heuristic that easily learned items are more likely to be remembered. Weaker inverse relationship between JOLs and ST was found for the younger children. Overall, these results underline the importance of mnemonic cues in shaping metacognitive feelings not only in adults but also in older children and expose a developmental trend in their use along childhood.}

  abstract = {A variety of experimental studies has suggested that Down's syndrome children perform at an inferior level relative to expected performance for their Mental Age. Comparative studies addressing this question have typically employed MA-matching procedures of questionable validity and have utilized experimental measures of unknown ecological validity. In the present study 24 pairs of Down's syndrome preschool and non-handicapped children were matched to MA as assessed by the Mental Scale of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development. An item-by-item analysis of the relative pattern of passes and fails on the scale indicated that despite the overall MA-match, the way in which the global score was achieved differed in the two groups. Non-handicapped children performed significantly better on subscales representative of fine motor development than the Down's syndrome children. The latter tended to compensate by doing somewhat better on language items, though not significantly so. All children executed a series of simple manipulative tasks analogous to a typical nursery toy (placing rods in holes). The imbalance in the matching appeared to carry through to performance on this task since the non-handicapped children tended to execute both phases of the task more quickly than their Down's syndrome peers. With regard to prehension, however, the groups did not differ with respect to sophistication of grip, though in one case the Down's children employed a more advanced palmar grip. Hand measurements were taken to see if this difference could be accounted for by greater maturation in the Down's syndrome group. This was found not to be the case, and the possible influence of greater experience of the relatively older Down's syndrome children is considered. Multiple influences on fine motor skill and its development are discussed, and alternatives to MA-matching considered.}

  abstract = {Engagement in early childhood is defined as a child’s level of participation with the environment. Engagement is an important construct in assessment and intervention of social and early learning competence given its link to school achievement. Few tools exist to assess engagement of young children in early education, and there is a need for a systematic direct observation tool that can be applied universally (e.g., with all young children) in these settings. This article describes preliminary evidence of validity and reliability for the Behavioral Observation of Students in Schools–Early Education (BOSS-EE). Specifically, the article describes results from a survey of experts and practitioners in which feedback was solicited on target behaviors and operational definitions, presents reliability data (i.e., interobserver and test–retest), examines correlations with a criterion measure, and describes variability across settings, sites, and methods (i.e., video vs. in vivo). Next steps in measurement development are discussed with attention to the challenges of producing a tool that can be used in a range of early education settings with diverse groups of young children.},

Expt 1 revealed that CWA did not recruit inner speech to facilitate arithmetic task-switching performance: there was no effect of articulatory suppression (AS) on completion time for CWA compared to the TD group. Expt 2 revealed that suppression of visuospatial resources disrupted the task-switching performance of both CWA and TD groups. It also confirmed that the task-switching performance of CWA was significantly slowed by visuospatial compared to AS. Expt 3 showed that CWA also did not employ inner speech, compared to visuospatial resources, for implementing planning movements. Overall, compared to the mixture of representations used by the TD group for problem solving, CWA seemed to use visuospatial working memory resources but not inner speech to service executive control.}

  abstract = {A sample of 315 children aged between 6 and 9 years participated in a 5-month longitudinal study aimed at investigating constraints on representational flexibility as observed in drawing behaviour. The study specifically looked at how external interventions affected children's representations over time. The intervention involved showing children various examples of pretend people in relation to Karmiloff-Smith's (1990) task of requesting children to operate on their normal person drawing procedures. The study confirmed that knowledge introduced exogenously was only beneficial immediately after the intervention. Over time, in contrast to the older children, the younger children reverted to their internal representations that were specified as sequentially fixed lists. The intervention did not promote transfer of learning to the analogous task of drawing pretend houses. The study suggests that exogenous provocations of behaviour are driven by adjunctions, and that reiterated cycles of representational redescription must occur before the externally mediated knowledge becomes flexibly manipulable.}

Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder, produce drawings that lack cohesion, yet drawing strategies in this group have hitherto not been investigated. In this study, WS and typically developing (TD) groups drew and constructed (from pre-drawn lines and shapes) a series of intersecting and embedded figures. Participants with WS made use of the same strategies as the TD group for simple intersecting figures, though were less likely to use a typical strategy for more complex figures that contained many spatial relations. When replicating embedded shapes, the WS group used typical drawing strategies less frequently than the TD group, despite attempting to initiate a strategy that is observed in TD children. Results suggested that individuals with WS show a particular difficulty with replicating figures that include multiple spatial relations. The impact of figure complexity and task demands on performance are discussed.}

This study explored individual differences in young siblings' IST in relation to (i) child characteristics (verbal ability and theory-of-mind task performance); (ii) family characteristics (sib-ship size; social disadvantage, maternal well-being); and (iii) the quality of the children's play with their siblings (frequencies of pretence and reciprocal play). A socially diverse sample of 111 2-year-olds was filmed at home playing with a sib (mean age =4.92 years; SD=1.67 years); these sessions were coded from video for reciprocal play and then transcribed and coded for IST and pretence. Verbal ability was assessed for both sibs; in addition, 2-year-olds completed theory-of-mind tasks. Age and verbal ability were correlated with frequencies of overall talk, IST, pretence and reciprocal play. (Theory-of-mind scores were also correlated with 2-year-olds' IST, but this relation fell below significance once verbal ability was controlled). Significant independent relations were found between IST and children's quality of play, even when age, verbal ability and overall rates of talk were controlled. Although there were no gender contrasts in mean rates or in the variety of IST, gender differences were found in their correlates: in particular, context effects were significantly more important for girls than for boys. Individual differences in children's IST reflect multiple factors, including the dynamic features of children's reciprocal play.}

The study demonstrates the feasibility of testing rudimentary executive function skills among preschoolers, using an original battery of tasks. The results were consistent with those from studies of older children (e.g. Welsh, Pennington \& Groisser, 1991), in that three aspects of executive function were distinguished: working memory, attentional flexibility and inhibitory control. In addition, specific links were found between executive function and theory-of-mind performance, even when age and both verbal and non-verbal ability were taken into account. In particular, children's deceptive abilities were closely related to success on tests of inhibitory control. The implications of these results for our understanding of deceit are discussed.}

  abstract = {Disruptive children have long been thought to show hedonistic rather than empathic attitudes to moral dilemmas, but accounts of what underlies this stance vary in different theoretical perspectives. Candidate factors include: general problems in verbal reasoning, specific delays in social understanding, reduced affective responsiveness and control, and negative parental influences. The present study is novel in examining each of these factors in a preschool-aged sample of disruptive children. In addition, interview assessments of moral awareness were compared with real-life observations of peer interactions to examine the ecological validity of such tasks. The study is also unusual in adopting a longitudinal design: the stability of group differences in moral awareness and its correlates was examined across a 2-year period spanning the transition to school. At age 4, 40 hard-to-manage children and their typically developing peers received a moral judgments and justifications interview and were filmed playing with a friend (Slomkowski \& Killen, 1992). At age 6, the two groups completed a moral-stories task (Arsenio \& Fleiss, 1996). Significant group differences were found at both time points; these differences showed stable relations with each of the correlates above, although the relation between interview measures of moral awareness and real-life behaviour was rather more complex. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that disruptive children show early and multi-faceted problems in socio-moral reasoning, that are associated with difficulties in their family and peer relationships.}

Theoretically, grandparents have a significant role in the intergenerational transmission of MLE strategies. The purpose of this study is to investigate the resemblances and unique characteristics of mothers' and grandmothers' MLE strategies. A sample of 52 Israeli families composed of mother–child and maternal grandmother–child dyads were videotaped at home in two conditions: free play and structured (the same child was observed in each dyad). The interactions were analysed using the observation of mediated interaction (OMI). Higher levels of MLE strategies were found during free play than in the structured condition. Positive correlations between grandmothers' and mothers' MLE strategies were found under both conditions. However, grandmothers provided a higher level of MLE strategies for intentionality and reciprocity, meaning, and transcendence, but less mediation of regulation of behaviour than mothers. It is concluded that these differences may be the result of either differences in the perceived roles of mothers and grandmothers, or differences in the levels of experience of mothers and grandmothers.}

It is understood as an active and constructive mechanism, whose capacity may be modified through continued practice. Indeed, each subject may generate his or her own attentional potential, which depends on the interaction of cognitive, conative, and affective factors. From this follows the relevance of research showing the effectiveness of different intervention strategies with the goal of boosting the functioning of different socio-cognitive-affective processes that have not yet achieved, for various reasons, an adequate level of development for a certain maturation stage. The goal of this chapter is to present a psychoeducational intervention program intended to contribute to the development of attentional and cognitive functioning. It is hypothesized that the implementation of intervention programs directed toward strengthening school children’s attentional resources will allow for an improvement in attentional efficacy in participating children, as compared with children not involved in the program.The results obtained by our team show that intervention programs have greater effectiveness if applied to small groups of school children, and greater improvement of attention is achieved if stimulation starts at earlier ages. In addition, greater effectiveness is attained if such programs are implemented systematically and sustained over time, with greater probabilities for them to help all children to develop cognitive and socio-affective skills that may enhance their educational opportunities.},

  abstract = {Recent theory suggests that the development of infants who experience obstetric adversities is mediated by their social interactions with their caregivers. This study examines the implied question of whether mothers' perceptions of their new-borns' behaviour reflect differences of obstetric optimality. Professionals' measures showed full-term new-borns with poor obstetric histories to be less alert and more fretful than comparisons, with standardized researcher measures showing the clearest differences. Mothers' diaries, ratings and impressions measures did not show such differences, probably due to a combination of new-born behavioural instability, contextual effects and effects of maternal perceptual and cognitive processes. The findings indicate the need for alternative methodologies for measuring constitutional and social-developmental contributions to infant behaviour. In addition, they emphasize that little is known about the bases for parents' views of their infants' characteristics, or the role of such views in maladaptive developmental relationships.}

Experiment 1 assessed the spontaneous and elicited play of 14 children with autism, matched on the basis of receptive language abilities to a group of 14 children with moderate learning difficulties. The children with autism produced significantly less pretend play than these controls, confirming previous findings. In contrast Expt 2 showed that the same group of children with autism were not impaired in their ability to carry out instructions thought to require pretend play. A third study compared the ability of 15 children with autism, and language-matched learning disabled and normal controls, to generate pretend acts. The children with autism produced pretend acts at a significantly slower rate than controls. It is argued, contrary to a meta-representational deficit account, that children with autism can engage in the mechanics of pretend play, but are impaired at producing pretence because of generativity problems. The extent to which a generativity deficit might be pervasive in autism is discussed.}

Results showed that individuals' theory of mind abilities determined their performance on false, but not true, pretence trials. These findings imply that meta-representation is involved when an individual has to make sense of a pretend state of mind that differs from their own, but, crucially, they also show that pretend play can often be understood without meta-representational competence.}

  abstract = {In today’s research environment, children’s diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors are commonly studied in the context of health, independent of their effect on cognition and learning. Moreover, there is little overlap between the two literatures, although it is reasonable to expect that the lifestyle factors explored in the health-focused research are intertwined with cognition and learning processes. This thematic review provides an overview of knowledge connecting the selected lifestyle factors of diet, physical activity, and sleep hygiene to children’s cognition and learning. Research from studies of diet and nutrition, physical activity and fitness, sleep, and broader influences of cultural and socioeconomic factors related to health and learning, were summarized to offer examples of research that integrate lifestyle factors and cognition with learning. The literature review demonstrates that the associations and causal relationships between these factors are vastly understudied. As a result, current knowledge on predictors of optimal cognition and learning is incomplete, and likely lacks understanding of many critical facts and relationships, their interactions, and the nature of their relationships, such as there being mediating or confounding factors that could provide important knowledge to increase the efficacy of learning-focused interventions. This review provides information focused on studies in children. Although basic research in cells or animal studies are available and indicate a number of possible physiological pathways, inclusion of those data would distract from the fact that there is a significant gap in knowledge on lifestyle factors and optimal learning in children. In a climate where childcare and school feeding policies are continuously discussed, this thematic review aims to provide an impulse for discussion and a call for more holistic approaches to support child development.},

Previous studies, however, have shown that 5-year-old children do not show this effect with purely visual presentation. In the present study, 5-year-olds were trained to carry out either overt or covert verbal rehearsal. Both groups showed significant effects of phonological similarity, but the overt rehearsal group produced a significantly larger one. A third group of children received no training in verbal rehearsal, and did not show differential recall of the two types of stimuli, thus replicating earlier work on 5-year-olds. This group did, however, show a primacy effect, despite the fact that this is generally thought to be a product of verbal rehearsal.}

Children were assessed on eight components of informal and formal mathematics achievement at ages 5–7 years. PD children were found to have significant impairments in some, mainly formal, components of mathematics by age 7 compared to TA children. Analysis also revealed that, by age 7, approximately half of the PD children met the criteria for PDMD, while the remainder exhibited less severe deficits in some components of formal mathematics. Children's mathematical performance at age 5, however, did not predict which PD children were more likely to become PDMD at age 7, nor did they differ in terms of phonological awareness at age 5. However, those PD children who later became PDMD had lower scores on verbal and non-verbal tests of general ability.}

Preschool, kindergarten and second-grade children made paired-comparison judgements of the mnemonic benefits of looking, naming, rehearsal and categorization in a free-recall task using categorizable materials. Measures of spontaneous strategy use and strategy imitation were also obtained. Preschoolers judged looking as significantly more effective than the other three strategies. The kindergartners showed no significant preference, while second graders judged rehearsal and categorization as significantly more effective than looking or naming. Preschoolers and kindergartners named to-be-remembered items, while most second graders used a grouping strategy. Significant relationships between strategic awareness and strategic behaviour were found across ages; however, correlations were not significant when the effect of age was removed. Thus, coordination between strategic knowledge and strategic behaviour appears to result from increases in both strategic awareness and the ease with which more effective strategies can be executed.}

Diverse aspects of sensorimotor experience, like action and context information, could play a key role in the formation and processing of manipulable object concepts. Specifically, contextual information could help to link specific actions experienced with different object exemplars. In this study, the effects of action and context priming on superordinate and basic-level categorization of manipulable objects were directly contrasted in 7- and 9-year-olds and in adults. Across the ages, results revealed a differential effect of hand and scene primes on conceptual processing at the superordinate and basic levels; the disadvantage of superordinate over basic-level categorization was reduced in the context priming condition in comparison to the action priming condition. The nature and role of contextual knowledge are discussed from a cognitive and a neurophysiological point of view. Directions for further developmental research on concepts are also considered.}

  abstract = {According to attachment theory, internal working models of attachment affect the way in which social and emotional information is processed. The current study examined this theoretical claim by investigating the association between attachment security and attention to facial emotional expressions in 5-year-old children. Attachment security was assessed on a representational level using an Attachment Story Completion Task. Children's attention to facial emotional expressions was measured during an eye-tracking task. Gaze data (fixation duration) were collected during the presentation of pictures displaying five different facial emotional expressions (neutral, angry, fearful, sad, and happy) of unfamiliar persons. Moreover, the Emotionality-Activity-Sociability Temperament Inventory was used to control for children's temperament and was filled out by children's mothers. Regression analyses revealed that attachment security was a significant predictor of children's attention to neutral and sad expressions while controlling for age, gender, and temperament. Moreover, a t-test revealed that securely attached children looked longer at the fearful expression than insecurely attached children. These findings provide direct evidence that even on a basic perceptional level attachment security is a predictor of children's emotional information processing. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Attachment representations substantially affect the way in which emotional information is processed. Insecure attachment representations are negatively related to children's attention to emotional stimuli. What does this study add? Eye-tracking technology was used to measure children's visual attention to facial emotional expressions. Secure attachment was related to prolonged visual attention to neutral and negative facial emotional expressions. Attachment security influences children's emotional information processing even on a basic perceptual level.},

  abstract = {Four experiments were conducted to investigate the role of the physical context in supporting 3- to 5-year-olds' use of spatiotemporal organization in recall. Children were familiarized with several target items and their corresponding landmarks arranged along a path in a model park. After familiarization, an experimenter removed the target items from the park. In Experiment 1, 3- and 4-year-olds recalled the missing items with the park either in view or out of view. When the park model was in view, 4- year-olds used the order of the items along the path to structure their recall. In Experiment 2, 4- and 5-year-olds recalled the missing items with the landmarks arranged either in the same order as in familiarization or in a new order. Children used the order of landmarks along the path at test to structure their recall, even though the order of landmarks changed from familiarization to test. Experiment 3 was identical to Experiment 2, except that the path was removed from the park. Five-year-olds used the order of landmarks along the path at test to structure their recall when the order of landmarks remained the same from familiarization to test, but had much more difficulty doing so when the order of landmarks changed from familiarization to test. Using a more difficult task, Experiment 4 revealed that spatiotemporal organization was positively related to amount recalled. Together, these findings suggest that the structure of the physical environment plays an important role in supporting young children's use of spatiotemporal organization in recall.}

This longitudinal study identified two groups of Grade 3 students based on their basic calculation abilities: students with persistent difficulties through Grade 4 (PD group) and students whose performance improved into the average range (IP group). Baseline data revealed a distinct cognitive profile for students in the PD group featuring predominant deficits in symbolic number processing. A conceptual intervention based on explicit teaching of basic arithmetic procedures was implemented when students attended Grade 5 or 6. Students in the PD group benefited more from the programme, especially in performing written calculations and in multiplication speed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Most interventions focus on young students' basic arithmetical skills to prevent serious math problems in future. Few interventions target older students who often face persistent math difficulties. These interventions are usually procedural and focus on age-appropriate math skills. What does this study add? A conceptual intervention was implemented to remediate basic calculation deficits at the end of elementary school. The aim was to help students compensate for their gaps in knowledge and motivate them to engage in math activities. Neuropsychological testing of arithmetic abilities revealed difficulties in symbolic number processing.},

Interpersonal predictors included the accuracy of parental mentalization, parental emotional availability, and teacher-reported child social skills. Intrapersonal child factors were child gender and verbal skills. Overall, children's EU increased significantly over time. After adjusting for child gender, age-4 EU, and parental socio-economic status, greater child verbal and social skills and greater parental mentalization each uniquely predicted growth in EU. Results are discussed in terms of theory and research on children's EU and parents' emotion socialization.},

  abstract = {Research into moral identity has provided much support for its role in mature moral functioning, yet the developmental course of this construct remains poorly understood. In this review, we examine the dominant developmental model of moral identity, which emphasizes its key relation with the moral self of early childhood. In reviewing evidence for the model, the assumption of correspondence between the moral self of early childhood and moral identity in adolescence is challenged, in terms of both the moral component and the sense-of-self entailed in both constructs. We argue that progress in mapping the developmental course of moral identity stands to be informed by a focus on middle childhood, which to date has been largely neglected in this literature, despite evidence implicating this period from related fields of inquiry. A number of specific directions for future developmental research into moral identity are outlined based on this perspective. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Moral identity is central to adolescent moral functioning. Early childhood ‘moral self’ becomes adolescent moral identity. What does this study add? The current dominant developmental model is examined. The model is found to have questionable validity. Middle childhood may be of unique importance to the emergence of moral identity.},

  abstract = {Research suggests that children exposed to maltreatment have deficits in executive functioning (EF) but few studies have focused on the adolescent age group. We investigated whether maltreated adolescents had lower EF abilities compared to a group of non-maltreated adolescents. Forty adolescents with histories of child maltreatment, together with a comparison group of 40 non-maltreated adolescents matched for age, completed a comprehensive battery of EF tasks. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses, controlling for IQ, were carried out using each of the EF measures as dependent variables to examine group differences. Maltreated adolescents had significantly lower performance than non-maltreated adolescents on tasks assessing executive loaded working memory, fluency, and inhibition, although switching was not impaired. Emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD) were included in additional regression analyses to examine whether these variables would explain the group differences. The inclusion of EBD variables had some effect on group differences, as expected, but did not eliminate them. These findings support the theory that impairments in EF may be one underlying reason why adolescents with histories of maltreatment struggle to cope both inside and outside the classroom.},

  abstract = {Executive functions or cognitive self-regulatory control processes are critical for children's ability to successfully navigate their academic and social environment. In this study, we focused on the development of one critical executive function skill, that of inhibitory control. In a longitudinal study, we tested 96 children at 24, 30, 36, 50, and 60 months of age with age-appropriate measures of inhibition. We found evidence for the developmental stability of inhibitory abilities. Inhibitory control at 30 months of age was strongly related to inhibitory control at 60 months of age even when verbal IQ was partialled out. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Prior research has shown that executive functions play a key role in children's academic as well as social development. However, evidence on the stability of individual differences in executive functions, especially in preschool children, is sparse and contradictory. What the present study adds? The present work was designed to investigate the stability of one particular executive function, namely inhibitory control, over a relatively large period of time, from 24 to 60 months of age. The most important finding is a robust correlation between Reverse Categorization at 30 months and Simon Says at 60 months (r = .56). We argue that this further highlights the importance of early EF interventions due to a possible ‘ripple effect’.},

  abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated age differences in prosocial behaviours and has focused on the development of theoretically prescribed cognitive abilities thought to be prerequisite. However, the empirical relations between cognitive abilities and prosocial behaviours have typically not been large and there has been considerable inconsistency in these findings. The present studies were based upon an information processing perspective that assumes task-specific cognitive demands for prosocial behaviours. In these studies, the effect of children's temporal monitoring abilities was examined as a logical prerequisite for the equal sharing of a desirable object within a limited time period. In the first study, age differences in equal sharing were partially accounted for by age differences in the temporal monitoring abilities of 5–12-year-old-children. In the second and third studies, 3–5-year-old preschool children shared more equally when there was a reduction in the cognitive demands involved in temporal monitoring. In addition, in all three studies motivational manipulations consisting of either an instructional set or the friendship status of the participating peer influenced equal sharing. These findings support the proposition that the range of prosocial behaviours available to children is limited by the development of task-specific cognitive abilities, and that the motivation properties of the situation also influence the expression of prosocial behaviours.}

Measures of self-regulation included effortful control (observed in the Parent–Child Study at 22, 33, and 45 months and in the Family Study at 25, 38, and 52 months) and rule-compatible conduct (observed in the Parent–Child Study at 56 and 73 months and in the Family Study at 38 and 52 months). In both studies, 2 PE measures had distinct implications: PE in scripted procedures related negatively, whereas PE in mother– child interactions related positively to self-regulation. In both studies, those differential effects were particularly clear for children’s effortful control. A view of early PE as having a heterogeneous nature may inform researchers’ understanding of its role in the developing personality.},

  abstract = {Investigating precursors to peer victimization, a particularly damaging form of peer maltreatment, represents an important research objective. This study's purpose was to evaluate the hypothesis that social helplessness is one mechanism underlying the pathway from early depressive symptoms to subsequent peer victimization among preadolescents in the third through fifth grades (N = 230; 126 girls; Mage at recruitment = 9.48; SD = 0.68). We collected self-reports of depressive symptoms and peer victimization and teacher reports of social helplessness in the fall of 2015 or 2016 (T1) and at two subsequent time points (T2 and T3) separated by 6-month lags. Results from a random intercepts cross-lagged panel model provided evidence for our hypothesized model in which T2 social helplessness partially mediated the effect of T1 depressive symptoms on T3 peer victimization. Findings underscore the importance of school-based prevention and youth development programmes that promote social-emotional learning for youth who are symptomatic for depression. Statement of contribution What is already known on the subject? Children's depressive symptoms and interpersonal dysfunction are related in a transactional way. Children who are symptomatic for depression tend to exhibit social-behavioural deficits. Depression-linked, social-behavioural deficits are associated with relationship disturbances. What does this study add? Children's socially helpless behaviour mediated the contribution of depressive symptoms to subsequent peer victimization. Depressive symptoms predicted, and were predicted by, socially helpless behaviour. Socially helpless behaviour increased risk for, but did not result from, peer victimization.},

  abstract = {The present longitudinal, naturalistic and cross-cultural study aims to investigate and extend our understanding of the intersubjective nature of the early imitations that may be observed in free interactions between young infants and their parents. Thirty infants, 15 from Greece and 15 from Scotland, were observed separately with their mothers and fathers at home every 2 weeks, from the second to the sixth month after birth. In each dyad, the emotional states of both interacting partners before, during and after the imitative episodes were subjected to microanalysis. The results indicate that emotional coordination, either by direct matching of expressions or by attunement, precedes, accompanies and follows imitation. This kind of coordination was found to be the same in Crete and Scotland, and for parents and infants of both sexes. It is concluded that this coordination of emotions with early imitative phenomena is evidence of motivational coherence, both within the subjects, and between them in an intersubjective play.}

  abstract = {The objective of this research is to test whether the contents and functions of young children's communication with fathers and mothers differ. Categories based on Speech Act Theory were used for the analysis of functions. As regards contents, messages were classified into three categories: (1) messages which refer to objects, actions or evaluations linked to task performance; (2) messages linked to characteristics of referents which are not linked to task performance; and (3) expressions of internal emotional states. The functions and contents of messages were analysed in two populations: American and French. Children were aged 20 to 26 months and were observed playing with a standard set of toys with each parent separately. The results show that fathers produce more messages linked to task performance and tend to produce more action directives than mothers and that, similarly, children produce more messages linked to task performance and more action directives with fathers than with mothers. Therefore, it seems that as young as 2 years of age, children adjust their communicative behaviours to fit characteristics of the interlocutor. Differences between the populations as well as the more precise nature of mother-child communication are also discussed.}

  abstract = {This study examines whether young children can differentiate between the situational antecedents of happiness and pride and the effect of the type of situation on the attribution of pride. One hundred and fifty 7-, 9- and 11-year-olds were asked to rate the extent to which two types of situations would elicit a protagonist's feelings of happiness and pride. Happy situations were expected to elicit happiness only, e.g. because the protagonist received a gift — a desirable result, but beyond his/her personal control. Achievement situations were expected to elicit both happiness and pride, e.g. because the protagonist won an award — a desirable and beneficial outcome for the agent which (s)he was responsible for bringing about. If the children could differentiate between the situational determinants of happiness and pride, they would be expected to give high ratings for pride in achievement situations only. To examine the effect of the type of situation on children's ratings for pride, discretionary moral situations were introduced in which the protagonist was performing a moral act for the benefit of a third person without personal cost (helping an old lady carry her shopping bags) or with cost (giving a sandwich to a hungry child). The results of the study revealed that only the 11-year-olds were able to fully differentiate between the two emotions. The type of situation affected children's ratings for pride. Children attributed less pride to the protagonist in moral situations, particularly in the cost condition, than to the protagonist in achievement situations.}

  abstract = {This study concerns children's understanding of photographs. The findings suggest that children's comprehension of photographs is not limited to recognizing depicted content but in addition involves an awareness of the specific medium of representation. Groups of 7- and 11-year-old children were interviewed about their knowledge of photography and were asked to respond to a series of photographs. The children were selected on the basis of their experience with photography and were pre-tested on several Piagetian tasks. The results revealed that the 7-year-olds showed some awareness of the photographic medium but when responding to actual photographs they tended to discuss only the depicted content. In contrast, the 11-year-olds showed an awareness of the way in which the photographic medium interacts with the depicted content; when responding to actual photographs these children's responses varied with different styles of photographs. Experience with photography influenced both the 7- and 11-year-olds' responses, while differences in performance on the Piagetian tasks were only associated with differences in the 11-year-olds' responses. These findings are discussed in terms of the importance of considering the characteristics of media in understanding children's representational abilities.}

In the first study, 4- to 6-year-olds and 7- to 9-year-olds were presented with a cup and a novel object to draw; in both cases the feature of primary functional importance was occluded. When the cup was named and examined prior to drawing only the younger children showed a high incidence of commission errors. When the novel object was named and examined and its function explained, by contrast, commission errors occurred very frequently in both age groups. In the second study, 4- to 5-year-olds and 8-year-olds were asked to draw two novel objects. As for Expt 1, naming and visual inspection accompanied by an explanation of function were found to provoke commission errors by both younger and older children. When the description of function was omitted, however, commission errors were almost entirely restricted to the younger participants. The present results demonstrate that model novelty may tempt children to include hidden features in their drawings beyond the age when commission errors are normally expected for familiar objects. One explanation of these findings is that the features included in children's drawings of a novel object represent those properties that are salient in the formation of a new concept.}

  abstract = {The study investigated adolescents' moral emotion expectancies for actions versus inactions across cultures (Chinese vs. Canadian) and different moral rule contexts (rules that prohibit antisocial behaviour vs. rules that prescribe prosocial actions) while controlling for judgements of obligatoriness of moral actions. The sample consisted of 372 teenagers from three grade levels (7–8, 10–11, and 1st–2nd year university). Participants were provided with scenarios depicting moral and immoral actions of self or others. Moral emotion expectancies were assessed following each scenario by asking participants to rate the intensity of various emotions they anticipate for themselves in the given situation. Actions were related to stronger self-evaluative and other-evaluative moral emotion expectancies than inactions in both cultures. Whereas perceived obligatoriness of moral actions was associated with moral emotion expectancies, it did not account for the actor effect. Moreover, Chinese adolescents tended to report stronger negatively charged other-evaluative emotions when observing others engaging in antisocial behaviour and less positive emotions for moral actions. Overall, the study indicates that moral emotion expectancies hinge upon universal moral principles (as exemplified by the actor effect) that interact with cultural values and individuals' moral judgement in complex ways.}

Results revealed that positively charged emotion expectancies were more pronounced in contexts of prosocial action than in the context of moral transgressions, whereas the opposite was true for negatively charged emotions.

  abstract = {Despite the wide adoption of measures of executive functions and motivational tendencies in studies of developmental disorders and child psychopathology, few studies have investigated their test-retest reliability. The present paper examines the reliability of a new measure of delay aversion, three measures of working memory, a response inhibition measure and a measure of dual task performance. The children, aged between 7 and 15 years, performed the tasks twice, with a 2-week period in between the sessions. Using a relatively conservative criterion, only the delay aversion task and one of the working memory measures (delayed response alternation) demonstrated satisfactory test-retest reliability. The other two working memory measures (sentence span and counting span) showed modest reliability. For the inhibition measure (stop task) the results were mixed, with poor to modest reliabilities obtained for the various derived measures. The dual task failed to demonstrate adequate test-retest reliability. These differential reliabilities need to be borne in mind when interpreting the results of studies using these measures. In particular the effect of low reliability on statistical power and the Type II error rate should be considered.}

Parental control dimensions and aggression subtypes were assessed using multiple informants (i.e. children, mothers, fathers, peers, and teachers). In line with expectations, parental physical punishment was positively associated with overt aggression, whereas parental psychological control was positively associated with relational aggression in both girls and boys. In addition, this study demonstrated that if both parents employed similar parenting strategies, it appeared to have a cumulative effect on child aggressive behaviour. Associations involving overt aggression were more pronounced for boys than girls, whereas associations involving relational aggression were not moderated by gender. Overall, the present study contributes to an emerging research field by supporting the hypothesis of specialized associations between parental control and child aggression.}

The objective of the study was to determine whether the presence or absence of cardinal values in pseudoerrors and the type of conventional rule violated affects children's performance. A detection task with pseudoerrors was presented through a computer game to 146 primary school children in grades 2 through 4. The same pseudoerrors were presented both with and without cardinal values; the pseudoerrors violated conventional rules of spatial adjacency, temporal adjacency, spatial–temporal adjacency, and left-to-right direction. Half of the participants within each age group were randomly assigned to an experimental condition that included pseudoerrors with a cardinal value, and the other half were assigned to a condition that included pseudoerrors without a cardinal value. The results show that when presented with a cardinal value, children more easily recognize the optional nature of non-essential counting features. Likewise, the type of conventional rule transgressed significantly affected the children's acceptance of pseudoerrors as valid counts. Participants penalized breaches of temporal and spatial–temporal adjacency to a greater degree than breaches of spatial adjacency and left-to-right direction.},

At 5.5 years, children were also assessed on the quality of moral reasoning and decision making they used to negotiate prosocial moral dilemmas, in which the needs of a story protagonist conflict with the needs of another story character. More sophisticated EU predicted greater use of physical- and material-needs reasoning, and a more advanced ToM predicted greater use of psychological-needs reasoning. Most intriguing, ToM and EU jointly predicted greater use of higher-level acceptance-authority reasoning, which is likely a product of children's increasing appreciation for the knowledge held by trusted adults and children's desire to behave in accordance with social expectations.}

This report contributes to analyze the proposed hypothesis that an experimentally induced discontinuity of a confluent cellular culture could represent a useful model for the analysis of the processes involved in a neural lesion. For this purpose, it was decided to characterize astroglial proliferation and dye coupling state after a “scratch wound” applied to confluent, astrocyte-enriched cell cultures, obtained from several rat brain regions. Proliferation was assessed in terms of bromodeoxyuridine nuclear incorporation as a function of lesion width, serum deprivation, time after confluence, brain region origin, postlesional culture medium changes and agitation, and after application of a gap-junction uncoupling agent. The proliferative reaction after injury was neither cell typespecific nor brain region specific, nor was significantly affected by neither of the above-mentioned variables. Furthermore, injury failed to significantly affect the astroglial dye coupling state. Results suggest that the proliferative response observed under present conditions would depend on the disruption of contact inhibition rather than on astroglial mitogenic signals released from the wound and operating by either extracellular or cell coupling mechanisms. Present results question the validity of astrocyte-enriched cell cultures as an experimental model of neural tissue injury in vivo, as they do not appear to reproduce fundamental characteristics expressed in situ.},

For this purpose, changes in \% immunoreactive (IR) area of GFAP, vimentin, EAAT1 and ezrin were evaluated in the perilesional zone after placing a cortical stab wound in the visual cerebral cortex of adult rats. GFAP-IR postlesional reactive astrocytosis in the perilesional cortex was significantly lower in the animal group exposed to EE during postnatal development. This GFAP-IR reaction seems to be associated with existing astroglia, because neither BrdU- nor endogenous Ki-67-labeled nuclei were found in the perilesional cortex analyzed. Increased ezrin-IR area in the visual cortex of rats exposed to EE condition suggests the formation of new synapses or the enhancement of astroglial involvement in the existing ones. No effects of EE were found on either EAAT1- or vimentin-IR area. Results suggest that exposure to EE conditions prior to injury attenuates the postlesional astroglia GFAP-response in the perilesional cortex of rats. Whether this attenuated postlesional astroglia GFAP-response promotes or not protective effects on the cortical neuropil remains to be explored in futures studies.},

The article next turns to a review of cross‐cultural similarities and differences in several aspects of parenting, including physical caregiving, cognitive stimulation, warmth and acceptance, control and monitoring, and discipline. Cultural normativeness and beliefs on the legitimacy of parental authority are then considered as potential moderators that contribute to cross‐cultural similarities and differences in relations between parenting and child outcomes.

This study investigated the extent to which executive function (EF) mediated associations between parental education and family income and changes in reading and math achievement in a sample of 336 children between the ages of 6 and 15 years from the NIH MRI Study of Normal Brain Development. Verbal memory was simultaneously modeled as a comparison candidate mediator. SES predicted significant changes in reading and math achievement over a two-year time period. Furthermore, executive function, but not verbal memory, was found to partially mediate the relationship between SES variables and change in math achievement. Collectively, these results suggest that executive function may be an important link between childhood SES and academic achievement},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The relationship between childhood socioeconomic status (               SES               ) and executive function (               EF               ) has recently attracted attention within psychology, following reports of substantial               SES               disparities in children's               EF               . Adding to the importance of this relationship,               EF               has been proposed as a mediator of socioeconomic disparities in lifelong achievement and health. However, evidence about the relationship between childhood               SES               and               EF               is mixed, and there has been no systematic attempt to evaluate this relationship across studies. This meta‐analysis systematically reviewed the literature for studies in which samples of children varying in               SES               were evaluated on               EF               , including studies with and without primary hypotheses about               SES               . The analysis included 8760 children between the ages of 2 and 18 gathered from 25 independent samples. Analyses showed a small but statistically significant correlation between               SES               and               EF               across all studies (               r               random               ~=~.16, 95\%               CI               [.12, .21]) without correcting for attenuation owing to range restriction or measurement unreliability. Substantial heterogeneity was observed among studies, and a number of factors, including the amount of               SES               variability in the sample and the number of               EF               measures used, emerged as moderators. Using only the 15 studies with meaningful               SES               variability in the sample, the average correlation between               SES               and               EF               was small‐to‐medium in size (               r               random               ~=~.22, 95\%               CI               [.17, .27]). Using only the six studies with multiple measures of               EF               , the relationship was medium in size (               r               random               ~=~.28, 95\%               CI               [.18, .37]). In sum, this meta‐analysis supports the presence of               SES               disparities in               EF               and suggests that they are between small and medium in size, depending on the methods used to measure them.},

  abstract = {The drawings of 17 children with Down's syndrome were compared to those produced by 17 typically developing children matched for receptive vocabulary. The children drew six arrays involving a toy bear with either a transparent or an opaque pot in three spatial arrangement: the bear was placed inside, behind or beside the pot. There was a wide variation in the children's drawings of the bear in both groups. In the Down's syndrome group, this was unrelated to chronological age, verbal mental age, language comprehension or to fine motor skills, but these measures were significantly related in the control group. Many of the children with Down's syndrome showed poor understanding of spatial concepts which was strongly related to grammar comprehension. Those with very poor understanding adopted inconsistent strategies to represent the different spatial arrays. Strategies were not related to the maturity of the bear drawings nor to most other variables, except that children using a developmentally more advanced strategy demonstrated superior pencil control. The research supported the possibility of a different pattern to drawing development in Down's syndrome rather than a delayed version of typical development.}

More attention is now paid to the impact of gender-segregated peer groups and other social relationships (e.g., friendships, romantic relationships) as well as cognitive-motivational and biological processes. Furthermore, the role of the larger social-structural context is addressed in studies of sexism and gender bias during childhood and adolescence. Recommendations for future research are offered.}

Sixty-seven children aged between 25 and 43 months (Mage in months = 34.80, SD = 4.39) participated in a temptation resistance paradigm (TRP). Children completed emerging ToM tasks measuring the following mental states: (1) diverse beliefs, (2) diverse desires, and (3) knowledge access. Children also completed measures of inhibitory control and working memory. In total, 63 of the 67 children peeked at the toy during the TRP, and a total of 26 of those children denied their transgression to the research assistant. Inhibitory control and understanding of knowledge access predicted lie-telling behaviour. Results are discussed in relation to a developmental model of children's lie-telling behaviour. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The relationship between lie-telling, executive functioning, and ToM has been established in older children (aged 4 and above). Inhibitory control plays a role in young children's lie-telling (aged 2–4). Children above 3 years of age have some understanding of mental states. What does this study add? Very young children (2–3-year-olds) also possess an understanding of mental states. Mental state understanding is related to 2–3-year-old children's lie-telling behaviours and may be more predictive than inhibitory control. While the results were not significant, this study is the first to look at the unique role of working memory in very young children's lie-telling.},

  abstract = {When children draw pictures of human beings, they reveal things not only about their general intellectual and artistic abilities, but also about their awareness and conception of themselves and others. What might the human figure drawings of children with autism reveal about their images of self and other – and what might they disclose about social factors that shape the drawings of children who do not have autism? On the basis of an hypothesis about the restricted social awareness of children and adolescents with autism, we predicted that there would be little differentiation between their drawings of themselves and other people. To test this prediction, we investigated a group of children and adolescents with autism and a group with learning difficulties but not autism (N = 14 per group) who were individually matched for both chronological age and verbal mental age. Participants with autism mostly drew human figures that were little distinguished from one another, but introduced clear contrasts among their houses, whereas most of those with learning difficulties drew distinctive human figures as well as houses. These different profiles of performance occurred despite similarities in the numbers and kinds of feature included in the drawings, and the individuality of participants' drawing styles. Although the results were in keeping with our hypothesis that human figure drawings might reflect abnormalities in the way that children with autism mentally represent themselves and others, we conclude by stressing our tentativeness over this interpretation of the findings.}

  abstract = {This study examined differences between children with autism and control children in the ability to follow another person's direction of gaze. In Expt 1, children with autism, Down syndrome and normally developing children were given two tasks. The gaze monitoring task (GMT) measured the child's spontaneous tendency to follow gaze direction in response to another person's change of head and eye movement. The visual perspective taking task (VPT) measured the child's ability to compute and report what the other person was looking at, when instructed to do so. Results showed that the majority of Down syndrome and normal children passed both tasks. In contrast, children with autism failed the GMT. This failure could not have been due to a lack of the relevant geometric skill, as they passed the VPT. This geometric skill was examined further in Expt 2, using a fine discrimination task which tested children's ability to discriminate degrees of change in the orientation of gaze. Children with autism were well within their developmental age level on this task. These results indicate a dissociation between (impaired) spontaneous monitoring and (intact) geometric analysis of gaze-direction.}

Data come from Waves 1 and 2 of the Child Development Supplement (CDS-I; CDS-II), a nationally representative sample of American children aged 0–12 in 1997 and 5–18 in 2002. Twenty-four hour time use diaries are used to assess children's time spent with media (television, video games, computers, and reading). Predictors examined include socio-demographics, neighbourhood quality, family factors, and other media use. Ordinary least square (OLS) multiple regressions were performed by three age groups (preschoolers, early school age, and preadolescence). The findings suggest that neighbourhood quality, parental limits and family conflict are significant predictors of children's media use within time or over time, but the significance depends on the type of media and child's developmental stage. In addition, children's television viewing and reading habits are formed early in life and reinforced over time. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence for the effect of early contextual factors on the life course of children's media use from a developmental perspective.}

Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses yielded three interrelated factors, which resembled those obtained by Miyake et al.

The infants were passively rotated through six complete turns inside a circular unpatterned enclosure. The procedure was intended to inform the infant about the constant location of an event during body rotation and to test the infant's ability to retrieve the non-framed event site when no exteroceptive information specified the event location. The event was sometimes present and sometimes absent. Two levels of position constancy were tested during the phases with the event absent: a directional one and a positional one. If the infants oriented their head towards the side where the event should reoccur rather than towards the other side, they were presumed to be able to directionally localize the non- perceivable event location. If they adjusted their head orientation to the event location, they were presumed to be able to positionally localize the non-perceivable event location. The results indicate directional ability in 11-, 14- and 19-month-olds, and positional ability in 19-month-olds only.}

This study examined the play of 18 children with visual impairments aged between 21 and 86 months on two structured tests of play. Appropriate functional play with miniature versions of everyday objects was distinguished from symbolic play involving substituting one object for another, pretending something has a property it does not have, or referring to something as if it were present. As a group, the children showed impaired functional and symbolic play. However, four children met the diagnostic criteria for autism and engaged in little or no play. When these children were excluded, the remaining children had lower functional play test scores than expected for their chronological age, but symbolic play test scores which were at the appropriate level for their chronological age. The functional and symbolic play of children with no vision or only light perception did not differ significantly from children with some vision. The production of symbolic play was strongly related to language ability, although functional play was not related to language ability. It is argued that children with visual impairment, but no behaviours characteristic of autism, can develop the ability to play both functionally and symbolically, but that lack of visual access to play materials may limit their ability to demonstrate these skills.}

  abstract = {Processes underlying reading in profoundly congenitally deaf children were investigated in three experiments using the Stroop paradigm, where subjects were required to respond to coloured letter strings displayed on a video-monitor. Each experiment examined two response measures: A manual one where subjects pressed the button corresponding to the appropriate colour, and a colour-naming task. Unpronounceable letter strings, pronounceable non-words, colour related and unrelated words were displayed as well as colour words. In both deaf and hearing children of similar reading skill the pattern was very similar. Colour words generated most interference in the vocal, least in the manual task, suggesting automatic access to word meaning (the manual task) and, additionally, to word pronunciation (the vocal task). In a second experiment, where unique letter strings were presented in different colours, the same general pattern was observed: These results are not limited to repeated associative pairings of colours and their names, suggesting that the deaf, like hearing children, have automatic access to word pronunciations in reading. In a third experiment, non-words that were homophones of incongruent colour words also produced interference with output forms for pronounceable letter strings. Taken together, these results indicate that access to orthographic, semantic and even phonological information can occur automatically when deaf children are presented with written words.}

  abstract = {Engagement in early childhood has been linked with later achievement, but the relation between these variables and how they are measured in early childhood requires examination. We estimated the overall association between academic engagement and achievement in children prior to kindergarten entry. Our systematic literature search yielded 13,521 reports for structured eligibility screening; from this pool of studies, we identified 21 unique data sets, with 199 effect sizes for analysis. We coded eligible studies, extracted effect sizes, accounted for effect size dependency, and used random-effects models to synthesize findings. The overall correlation between academic engagement and achievement was r\,=\,.24 (range: −.08 to .71), and moderator analyses did not significantly predict the relation between the two constructs. This study aligns with previous research on this topic and examines issues related to these measures, their constraints, and applications as they pertain to early childhood research.},

  abstract = {Introduction The study of the influences of material and social deprivation on the central nervous system (CNS) has been an issue of interest in the agenda of neuroscience since the first half of the twentieth century. Early neuroscientific studies have begun to analyse how the exposure to complex, standard or deprived environments modifies the brain in the context of experimental animal models. At present, the same approach still applies to the analysis of how different rearing environments modulate the brain structure and function at molecular, genetic, cellular, network, individual and social behaviour levels (Mohammed et al., 2002; Pang \& Hannan, 2013; Sale et al., 2009; Simpson \& Kelly, 2011). Moreover, the study of stress regulation, which also has an extensive history in the neuroscience agenda, has addressed the impact of different threatening experiences on the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis (HPA axis) functioning (Feder et al., 2009; Joëls \& Baram, 2009; Karatoreos \& McEwen, 2013; Lupien et al., 2009). More recently, stress regulation analysis began to be applied to the study of poverty and cognitive development through different perspectives, such as vulnerability and environmental susceptibility (Ellis \& Boyce, 2011; Sheridan et al., 2013; Theall et al., 2013), executive functions performance (Blair et al., 2011; Evans \& Fuller-Rowell, 2013), and child development policy (Shonkoff \& Bales, 2011). During the twentieth century research programs emerged to analyse the influences of malnutrition (Antonov-Schlorke et al., 2011; Georgieff, 2007) and the exposure to different types of pollutants (Hubbs-Tait et al., 2005; Jacobson \& Jacobson, 2004) and drugs (Thompson, 2009) at pre- and postnatal brain development stages, with significant implications for the neuroscientific study of social inequities. The neuroscientific study of human poverty, particularly child poverty, is an issue that has recently emerged (Gi- 1 Unidad de Neurobiología Aplicada (UNA, CEMIC-CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina. Bread and Brain, Education and Poverty Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Scripta Varia 125, Vatican City 2014 www.pas.va/content/dam/accademia/pdf/sv125/sv125-lipina.pdf 2 Bread and Brain, Education and Poverty SEBASTIÁN J. LIPINA anaros \& Hackman, 2013; Hackman et al., 2009, 2010; Lipina \& Colombo, 2009). Since the mid-nineties different researchers have begun to apply neurocognitive behavioural paradigms to compare the performance of children with disparate socioeconomic status (SES) (e.g., Farah et al., 2006; Lipina et al., 2004, 2005, 2013; Lawson et al., 2013; Mata et al., 2103; Mezzacappa, 2004; Noble et al., 2005). Technological advances in neuroimaging allowed the incorporation of neural network analysis (e.g., D’Angiulli et al., 2008, 2012b; Jednoróg et al., 2012; Krishnadas et al., 2013; Monzalvo et al., 2012; Noble et al., 2006, 2012, 2013; Raizada et al., 2008; Rao et al., 2010; Sheridan et al., 2012, 2013; Stevens et al., 2009). Taking into consideration all these research efforts, the study of how different environmental conditions (e.g., disparate SES or poverty) influence brain organization and reorganization during development includes different approaches, such as neural plasticity, epigenetics, influence of environmental toxins, nutrition, stress regulation, poverty modulation of cognitive and emotional processing, and poverty perception of adults with a history of poverty at childhood (Hackman et al., 2009, 2010; Lipina \& Colombo, 2009). Some of the main questions currently included in this neuroscientific agenda focus on some topics already analysed in the fields of developmental psychology, cognitive psychology and health sciences, especially regarding the effects and mechanisms of mediation at the behavioural level of analysis (Bradley \& Corwyn, 2002; Brooks-Gunn \& Duncan, 1997; Evans et al., 2013; Lipina \& Colombo, 2009; McLoyd, 1998; Moffitt et al., 2011; Reiss, 2013; Schreier \& Chen, 2013; Yoshikawa et al., 2012). Nonetheless, the intrinsically innovative aspect of the neuroscientific agenda is that neuroscience allowed the beginning of these explorations in terms of basic mental operations considering different levels of analysis (i.e., genetics, networks, behaviour). In this sense, during the last decade different researchers began to produce evidences regarding how disparate socioeconomic status or deprivations modulate different aspects of neural processing and neurocognitive performance in tasks with language and cognitive control demands – the two neurocognitive systems in which poverty modulation appears to be most frequent (Gianaros \& Hackman, 2013; Hackman et al., 2009, 2010; Lipina \& Colombo, 2009; Lipina \& Posner, 2012; Raizada \& Kishiyama, 2010). Addressing the mechanisms of mediation of the impact of child poverty on cognitive development is also a recent issue of interest and study in the context of neuroscience (Hackman et al., 2010). In other related disciplines, such as the study of pollutant or toxic agent neurotoxicity and malnutrition, these issues began to be explored earlier. However, even in the latter case (i.e., nutrition) only recently have researchers begun to include current neuBread and Brain, Education and Poverty 3 BIOLOGICAL AND SOCIOCULTURAL DETERMINANTS OF NEUROCOGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT roimaging technologies, which would eventually allow improving its comprehension (e.g., Jackson \& Kennedy, 2013; Sheinkopf et al., 2009). To generate changes in neurocognitive development, interventions have been recently implemented for the study of attentional disorders (e.g., Thorell et al., 2009), dyslexia (McCandliss et al., 2003; Shaywitz et al., 2004; Temple et al., 2003), dyscalculia (Wilson et al., 2006), attentional development in healthy children (Rueda et al., 2005), executive functions (Colombo \& Lipina, 2005; Lipina et al., 2012; Neville et al., 2013b), and arithmetic performance (Wilson et al., 2009) in samples of children from different SES backgrounds. In all these studies, the behavioural levels of analysis have been emphasized, and neuroimaging techniques (Rueda et al., 2005; Shaywitz et al., 2004; Temple et al., 2003) and behavioural genetics (Espinet et al., 2012; Neville et al., 2013b; Rueda et al., 2005, 2012) have been included in some cases. Further research is required in terms of (1) the theoretical and methodological integration of developmental psychology and cognitive psychology hypotheses to the neuroimaging studies devoted to explore neurocognitive development, and intervention studies focused on better cognitive and emotional performances, both in disparate SES samples of infants, children and adolescents (Crone and Ridderinkhof, 2011; Gianaros \& Hackman, 2013); and (2) the inclusion in this agenda of the exploration of how improve the comprehension of effects and mediation mechanisms beyond the most univariate approach proposed by neuroimaging techniques (e.g., Lipina \& Posner, 2012; Noble et al., 2013). This chapter proposes a brief review of findings, conceptual and methodological contributions and challenges about the present neuroscientific approach of childhood poverty. The aim of this effort is to visualize target areas, which could potentially help to build a research agenda for the coming years. In this context of discussion, it would be wise to determine which is or would be the specific contribution of neuroscience that differs from that made by other disciplines.},

Entre tales tipos de procesos se suelen incluir aquellos involucrados en la identificación de elementos comunes entre diferentes ítems, la generación y mantenimiento de ideas acerca de tareas o de información relevante para resolverlas, la inhibición de conductas familiares o estereotipadas, el rechazo de información que no es relevante para la realización de tareas, la manipulación de información novedosa acerca de una tarea o una situación, el cambio entre objetivos para lograr tareas, la planificación de conductas y el uso de información relevante para la toma de decisiones. Este conjunto variado de procesamientos, da cuenta de un amplio rango de fenómenos que tienen lugar en diferentes situaciones de la vida cotidiana, durante las distintas etapas del desarrollo cognitivo (e.g., atención, control inhibitorio, memoria de trabajo, flexibilidad cognitiva, automonitoreo y planificación). Debido a que este constructo hace referencia a un dominio amplio de competencias, no es posible determinar una manera estandarizada de evaluarlo. Por el contrario, en la investigación psicológica se suelen utilizar diferentes pruebas para evaluar sus distintos aspectos y subprocesos (Banich, 2009; Diamond, 2013).},

Se administró una batería de pruebas que evalúan componentes de flexibilidad cognitiva, logro de objetivos y control atencional. Los resultados obtenidos muestran perfiles de desempeño diferentes entre ambos grupos. El perfil de desempeño menos eficiente en términos de las variables estudiadas se observó en el grupo de niños proveniente de hogares pobres.

Las diferentes formas utilizadas para referirse a este fenómeno multidimensional, cuya reducción conceptual a una cuestión sólo de ingresos suele ser un error grave y frecuente, se basan fundamentalmente en metodologías que miden privación de bienes y servicios de la población general. Ello deja de lado cuestiones insoslayables de la pobreza, como los derechos humanos y la forma de experimentarla por parte de los niños. Sólo los indicadores IPH-1 e IPH-2 utilizados por el PNUD involucran componentes referidos a la privación de derechos humanos básicos. Pero aún en este último caso, tampoco se incluye la noción de cómo la pobreza afecta a las poblaciones infantiles, ni las dimensiones específicas de privación involucradas. Hasta el momento, en nuestro conocimiento sólo existe un estudio que da cuenta de estos aspectos discriminados por región mundial (Gordon y cols., 2003). Según el mismo, la situación de la pobreza infantil en términos de privaciones graves en el año 2003 para la población de menores de 18 años de América Latina y del Caribe, era la siguiente: a) el 21\% (41.397.930 de niños) habitaba en viviendas donde compartía habitaciones con más de cinco personas o no tenía pavimento como mínimo en sus pisos; b) el 16\% (31.541.280 de niños) no tenía acceso a ningún tipo de letrina en las cercanías de su vivienda; c) el 7\% (13.799.310 de niños) sólo tenía acceso a agua de superficie para beber, o vivía en hogares cuya única fuente de agua potable se encontraba a más de quince minutos de distancia; d) otro 7\% no había sido vacunado contra ninguna enfermedad, o siendo menores de 5 años había sufrido recientemente diarrea y no había sido atendido por ningún médico ni recibido tratamiento; e) el 5\% (9.856.650 de niños) tenía altura y peso en proporción a la edad en un nivel de más de tres desviaciones típicas por debajo del percentil medio de la población internacional de referencia; f) otro 5\% de niños entre 3 y 18 años (9.856.650) carecía en el hogar de acceso a radio, televisión, teléfono o periódicos; y g) un 3\% de niños entre 7 y 18 años (5.913.990) nunca había ido a la escuela (Gordon y cols., 2003). Aún desconociendo con exactitud los niveles de privación intermedios y leves, de los que no se cuenta con información, la situación constituye una pandemia, cuya solución requiere respuestas multidimensionales que incorporen la noción de equidad y mejor distribución de ingresos (ver apartados 3 y 4 para mayor detalle)},

  abstract = {In the past few decades, a particular need for a child-centered perspective has emerged, based on evidence that children are more susceptible to environmental and social risks, and that they have different needs than adults do. This article examines issues affecting children in existing measurements and presents conceptual considerations for future work toward defining and measuring child poverty. Current definitions and measures of poverty are generally circumscribed to levels of income, satisfaction of basic needs, and issues of basic human rights; in a few cases, some well-being measures include child health, nutrition, and education. These limitations likely impede the chances that researchers will be able to capture and understand the effects of other important aspects of this phenomenon. Measures need to address the diversity of issues and dimensions that current child developmental frameworks define as the most important. A broader approach to definition and measurement that includes these developmental issues would not only affect the way we understand poverty but also inform the design of future research, social programs, and policies.},

  abstract = {Child poverty and child development are complex and multidimensional phenomena. The study of their interaction involves the analysis of different biológica! and psychosocial components within a continuous, dynamic, and growing interaction (Bradley \& Corwyn, 2002; Evans, 2004; Lipina \& Colombo, 2009). Henee, their study requires the involvement of multidisciplinary frameworks that consider different epistemological, conceptual, methodological, cultural, and ethical issues. Specifically, over the last decade, neuroscientists have begun to join collaborative effbrts with developmental and social scientists to contribute, both conceptually and methodologically, to the study of the eífects of poverty on basic cognitive processes (Hackman, Farah, \& Meany, 2010; Lipina \& Colombo, 2009; Raizada \& Kishiyama, 2010). Considering the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive, emotional, and learning competences, new exploratory avenues aimed at understanding the socioeconomic gaps affecting them could be opened. In addition, neurocognitive analysis may reveal different socioeconomicrelated factors, playing several mediating roles across neurocognitive systems. In turn, examining which underlying factors are associated with cognitive, emotional, and/or learning competences allows the design of testing interventions with increased specificity.},

To enhance generation, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning method that significantly boosts the performance of RAG. For effective retrieval, we introduce a dense retriever optimized for conversational QA, which yields results comparable to the alternative state-of-the-art query rewriting models, while substantially reducing deployment costs. We also present the ChatRAG Bench, which encompasses ten datasets covering comprehensive evaluations on RAG, table-related QA, arithmetic calculations, and scenarios involving unanswerable questions. Our ChatQA-1.0-70B (score: 54.14), built on Llama2, a weaker foundation model than GPT-4, can slightly outperform GPT-4-0613 (score: 53.90) and GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 (score: 54.03) on the ChatRAG Bench, without relying on any synthetic data from OpenAI GPT models. Notably, the Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B model surpasses the accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, achieving a 4.4\% improvement. To advance research in this field, we open-sourced the model weights, instruction tuning data, ChatRAG Bench, and retriever for the community: https://chatqa-project.github.io/.},

Participants were N = 945 fourth-grade students (485 boys, 460 girls; Mage = 10.16 years, SD = 2 months) attending elementary schools in Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Three waves of data on peer victimization, depression, and academic achievement were collected from peer nominations, self-reports, and school records, respectively. The results indicated that peer victimization had both direct and indirect effects on later depression and academic achievement. Depression also had both direct and indirect negative effects on later academic achievement, but demonstrated only an indirect effect on later peer victimization. Finally, academic achievement had both direct and indirect negative effects on later peer victimization and depression. The findings show that there are cross-cultural similarities and differences in the various transactions that exist among peer victimization, depression, and academic achievement. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Peer victimization directly and indirectly relates to depression and academic achievement. Depression directly and indirectly relates to academic achievement. Academic achievement directly and indirectly relates to depression. What the present study adds? A developmental cascade approach was used to assess the interrelations among peer victimization, depression, and academic achievement. Academic achievement mediates the relation between peer victimization and depression. Depression is related to peer victimization through academic achievement. Academic achievement directly and indirectly relates to peer victimization. Academic achievement is related to depression through peer victimization.},

  abstract = {Despite more than 25 years of research there is still dispute about the growth curve of referential communication. It is usually maintained that this capacity is in place by 7 years of age but a few studies have uncovered deficits in the later stages of primary school. The issue is important given the role played by verbal information processing in education. This study examined referential communication in Italian and English children at 6 and 9 years, tested individually. Sex and socio-economic status (SES) were also main variables. A sensitive scoring system allowed the effects of feedback to be examined. The group data showed that 9-year-olds were significantly better speakers than 6-year-olds and that Italian children produced considerably more redundancy in their descriptions. As listeners, all children handled adequate messages well but with ambiguous messages age, sex and SES were significant main effects. Subject-by-subject analysis showed that less than 10 per cent of 6-year-olds and only 20 per cent of 9-year-olds were consistently able to detect ambiguity in messages, unaided. Cultural differences in the ability to profit from feedback were also revealed. The implications of the results for theoretical positions in referential communication and for the processing of verbal information in the classroom are discussed. It is concluded that there is a strong case for developing a standardized test of speaker and listener skills.}

It is argued that an understanding of how children handle verbal messages is important for theoretical and applied (especially educational) reasons, but that a methodological shift is needed. An approach is outlined that uses tasks with clear goals that enable children to perceive the purpose of communication. Telephones replace the customary talking-through screens, which also removes the distorting presence of the experimenter. The implications of the experimenter traditionally playing the dual role of investigator and task communicator are examined. When the age of the children demands the presence of an adult, that person's contribution must be measured. Detailed coding of verbal and non-verbal behaviour, drawing on developments in discourse analysis, are outlined together with some illustrative findings. The paper concludes with some proposed future fruitful lines of enquiry.}

  abstract = {Prior research has documented robust associations between adolescent religiousness/spirituality (R/S) and psychopathology outcomes including externalizing and internalizing symptomatology, yet no previous studies have examined these associations with adolescent R/S profiles using a person-centred approach. We examined whether there are identifiable subgroups characterized by unique multidimensional patterns of R/S experiences and how these experiences may be related to externalizing and internalizing symptomatology. The sample consisted of 220 Appalachian adolescents between 12 and 18 years old who were primarily White and primarily Christian. Latent profile analysis revealed three profiles of adolescent R/S: high religiousness (28.4\%), introjectors (47.6\%), and low religiousness (24.0\%). These profiles were differentially related to internalizing and externalizing symptomatology such that the high religiousness group was significantly lower than the introjectors with respect to internalizing and externalizing symptomatology and lower than the low religiousness group in externalizing symptomatology. Implications and suggestions for future research using person-centred approaches to better understand differential developmental trajectories of religious development are provided. Statement of contribution What is already known Prior research has demonstrated a negative relationship between adolescent religiousness and spirituality (R/S) and psychopathology. Numerous studies document the differential relationships between aspects of R/S and psychopathology; however, few have done so from a person-centred perspective. There are several theories that outline how R/S to study R/S when paying specific attention to culture. Saroglou's Big Four dimensions of religion (believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging) posits that these four dimensions (1) are able to delimit religion from proximal constructs; (2) translate major distinct dimensions of religiousness; (3) can be seen across cultural contexts; and (4) are good candidates to study cultural variability in religion due to their diversity; however, to the authors’ knowledge there has been no attempt to synthesize the Big Four dimensions and person-centred work. What the present study adds The present study found three profiles of adolescent R/S: high religiousness, low religiousness, and of particular interest, the introjectors. Those high in introjection seem to have a partial internalization of religiousness due to their low score in private practices but moderate to high scores on other aspects of religiousness. This group would not have been found through the use of traditional data analysis techniques or even through structural equation models. Importantly, those in the introjector group were also significantly higher in internalizing symptomatology than those in the high religiousness group, and higher in externalizing symptomatology than both the high religiousness and low religiousness. This ‘u-shaped’ pattern in which those in the middle-range of R/S were the worst off would also not have been found using traditional data analysis techniques.},

However, this research has overlooked older adults. We argue it is important looking at this age group as there is mixed evidence given that on one hand they have been described as exhibiting a positivity bias (hedonic orientation; preference for positive emotion goals), and on the other hand, being capable of suppressing this when it is adaptive to do so. Importantly, this bias towards positive emotion goals has been linked to better emotion regulation and higher well-being in older adults. In order to understand whether older adults can also exhibit instrumental emotion goals and whether this is linked to well-being, we conducted an exploratory study with older (N = 43, Mage = 68.33), middle (N = 47, Mage = 43.83), and young adults (N = 47; Mage = 21.98) who reported about their general and contextual emotion goals (in collaboration and confrontation), their well-being, and their current positive and negative affect. Although older adults reported lower negative affect than young adults, there were no age differences for general and contextualized emotion goals. Across the three age groups, a higher preference for happiness in general and in collaboration was linked to higher well-being. The obtained results highlight the need to study emotion goals longitudinally to better understand their possible changes throughout the lifespan and their influence on well-being.},

The experimental task presented a cue on each trial that instructed the participant to either read aloud the forthcoming word or name the colour of the word's lettering. Participants were tested with each of two cue-stimulus delays (1,000 and 5,000 ms). Analysis of error rates in the colour-naming condition revealed that children experienced greater interference than adults at each of the cue-stimulus delays. In an effort to separate the relative contributions of colour-naming and word-reading processes, additional analyses were performed based on the process dissociation procedure of Lindsay and Jacoby (1994). While colour-naming process estimates did not vary with age group or cue-stimulus delay, word-reading process estimates were found to vary with age group and cue-stimulus delay. Specifically, adults were superior to children in the inhibition of irrelevant word information only during a long cue-stimulus delay. Collectively, these findings indicate that children have difficulty maintaining task goals in order to suppress stronger, goal-irrelevant responses.}

Twenty-four children at each of three age levels (5-year-olds, 7-year-olds, and 10- year-olds) were studied. We assessed (a) children's level of negational thinking on a Piagetian task of affirmation/negation; (b) children's cost-perception/gain-construction conceptions on a hypothetical prosocial dilemma; and (c) children's prosocial behaviour in a contrived donating situation. Two cohorts involved in this study were also participating in a two-year longitudinal research programme on cost-perception/gain-construction individual change. Consistent with predictions, (a) cross-sectional data showed that with increasing age children become more likely to consider prosocial acts in terms of gain rather than cost; (b) longitudinal data showed that this children's tendency changes in the direction of ‘higher levels’(i.e. from cost perception to gain construction) and without regression; and (c) correlational data showed that this tendency is positively related to level of negational thinking, on the one hand, and positively associated with level of prosocial behaviour, on the other. These findings strengthen the hypothesis of explaining children's development of prosocial behaviour in accordance with the two Piagetian micromodels mentioned above.}

Children with ASD (N=27) and matched typically developing (TD) children were administered Karmiloff-Smith's (1990) imaginative drawing task, along with measures that tapped specific executive functions (generativity, visuospatial planning, and central coherence processing style) and false belief theory of mind (ToM) understanding. The ASD group drawings displayed deficits in imaginative content and a piecemeal pictorial style. ASD participants also showed group deficits in generativity, planning and ToM, and exhibited weak coherence. Individual differences in generativity were related to imaginative drawing content in the ASD group, and the association was mediated through planning ability. Variations in weak coherence were separately related to a piecemeal drawing style in the ASD group. Variations in generativity were also linked with imaginative drawing content in the TD group; the connection unfolded when it received pooled variance from receptive language ability, and thereupon mediated through false belief reasoning to cue imaginative content. Results are discussed in terms of how generativity plays a broad and important role for imagination in ASD and typical development, albeit in different ways.}

Less sensitive parenting of the mother and harsher parenting of the father were related to lower scores of emergent metacognition and inhibitory self-control. Parenting was not associated with child flexibility. This study extends previous research on the association between parenting and EF by the focus on the role of the father and demonstrates independent effects of mother and father on child EF.},

  abstract = {Tema for denne masteroppgaven er relasjoner mellom barn og voksne i barnehagen og små barns evner til selvregulering. Et av målene er å undersøke samvariasjonen mellom førskolebarnets kommunikasjon og positivt engasjement med voksne og barnets evne til selvregulering. For å studere denne samvariasjonen benyttes data innhentet ved hjelp av inCLASS, et observasjonsmateriell som er utviklet ved University of Virginia og tilpasset til norske forhold. Generelt nivå på barn-voksne relasjoner og sammenheng mellom relasjoner og kjønn er også en del av problemstillingen i denne oppgaven.    Det teoretiske perspektivet som ligger til grunn for denne studien er et sosiokulturelt syn på læring. Dette læringsperspektiv hevder at mennesker utvikler seg innenfor et samspill med miljøet rundt og at virkeligheten konstrueres ved hjelp av medierende redskaper. Gjennom å ta utgangspunkt i tilknytningsteori settes relasjoner og relasjoners betydning for læring og utvikling inn i en større kontekst. Nyere teori og forskning på området er brukt for å belyse relasjoners betydning for barns evne til selvregulering og hvordan dette igjen påvirker akademisk læring.     Dette er en tverrsnittstudie med en kvantitativ, empirisk tilnærming. 236 førskolebarn fra 19 barnehager i Klepp kommune er observert ved hjelp av inCLASS. Datamaterialet fra til sammen 9440 observasjonssekvenser er analysert ved hjelp av deskriptiv statistikk, faktoranalyser samt regresjons-og interaksjonsanalyser.    Resultatene i denne studien viser et generelt lavt nivå på relasjoner mellom barn og voksne. Sammenhengene mellom Relasjoner med voksne og Konfliktfylt og krevende atferd er ikke signifikante på faktornivå, men det fremkommer signifikant samvariasjon mellom noen av dimensjonsvariablene innenfor disse faktorene. Det kommer frem at Positivt engasjement med voksne og Kommunikasjon med voksne har en signifikant negativ sammenheng med Konflikt med jevnaldrende, og at dette gjør seg mest gjeldende blant gutter. Det kan se ut som om relasjoner med voksne kan beskytte mot konflikter med jevnaldrende blant gutter. Da dette er resultater som baseres på tverrsnittsdata, kan retningen på sammenhengen også gå andre veien. Det kan tenkes at voksne trekker seg unna gutter med en konfliktfylt og krevende atferd. Ut fra teorigrunnlaget i denne studien vil en gå ut fra at relasjonene kommer først, men begge mulighetene inviterer til videre forskning.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that reinstatement of spatial and temporal background information during learning can promote memory retention in adults. However, the effect in children is unclear. In order to explore the effect of episodic context reinstatement on the memory retention of different age groups, first-grade students, third-grade students, and third-year college students studied two word lists. When the words were presented mixed together, the participants were told to either restudy the words under intentional learning conditions or make list discrimination judgements by indicating the list from which each word had originated. Results revealed that the retrieval practice based on the episodic context reinstatement paradigm showed a phased development trend in the participants compared to restudy. Episodic context reinstatement only promoted memory retention in the third-grade children and college students, but not in the first-grade children. During the early elementary school years, children do not have relatively mature episodic memory ability and cannot output memories according to context clues. Our finding suggests important guidance for the age-appropriate use of tests as instructional tools in basic education. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? One recent theory of retrieval-based learning is the episodic context account; it promotes memory retention by reinstate the context of a prior learning episode. Previous studies have confirmed in the adults that the episodic context reinstatement was the main reason for retrieval practice to promote memory retention through the list discrimination tasks What does this study add? This study revealed that the retrieval practice based on the episodic context reinstatement paradigm showed a phased development trend in the participants. Episodic context reinstatement only promoted memory retention in the third-grade children and college students, but not in the first-grade children, and the results support the episodic context assumption, namely that episodic context reinstatement is the key factor in memory retention. The results of this study can explain why most prior work has observed the effect of retrieval practice in the groups above grade three.},

  abstract = {Started in the early 1970’s, this work was inspired by social interaction analysis based on direct observation and careful coding of behaviors according to a list of behavioral (mostly ethological) categories. Especially the ethological work of N. Tinbergen, K. Lorenz and K. von Frisch, for which they shared a Nobel Prize in 1973 in Medicine or Physiology, but also H. Montagner’s ethological analyses of interactions in social insects and children. S. Duncan’s psychological and linguistic research on turn taking in human interactions provided great inspiration and so did Chomsky’s work on syntactic structure and Skinner’s probabilistic real-time functional analysis and their consequent debate. A hypothesis concerning numerous kinds of temporal and spatial natural and especially biological structure, the T-pattern is a hierarchical self-similar fractal-like structure recurring with significant translational symmetry on a single discrete dimension, initially real-time. It also points to profound self-similarity across many levels of biological spatio-temporal organization as it seems characteristic of molecular structure such as genes and a multitude of recurrent motives on DNA and its 3D generalization corresponds to (3D) folded proteins. Developed initially to facilitate empirical analysis, the T-pattern and its detection algorithms were first presented in A.I. (Magnusson, 1981) and in Applied Statistics (Magnusson, 1983) through the THEME (3k Fortran IV) software using an evolution algorithm. It is now over 300k lines of code, runs under Windows and recently uses parallel processing for increased speed. This has allowed abundant detection of hidden structure in numerous kinds of biological phenomena at highly varied scales from human behavior at time scales of days (Hirschenhauser, 2002, 2005) to interactions of many individual neurons simultaneously registered at a temporal resolution of 10-6 s in neuronal networks in rat brains to ongoing work on T-patterns in DNA molecules at a spatial nano scale. T-pattern detection and analysis (TPA) thus mixes qualitative and quantitative analyses as T-patterns themselves are artificial categories composed of recurring coding categories with special real-scale statistical relations between their instances. After their detection T-patterns are thus analyzed much as other behavioral categories.},

Results revealed that 7-year-olds outperformed 3-year-olds on the episodic foresight task that involved cool processes, but did not show age differences in performance on the task that involved hot processes. In fact, both 3- and 7-year-olds performed equally poorly on the task that required predicting a future physiological state that was in conflict with their current state. Further, performance on the two tasks was unrelated. We discuss the results in terms of differing developmental trajectories for episodic foresight tasks that differentially rely on hot and cool processes and the universal difficulties humans have with predicting later outcomes that conflict with current motivational states.},

The present study attempts to combine different theoretical accounts by measuring VSWM. A battery composed of 13 tests was used to assess working memory and, in particular, the hypothesized mechanisms involved in the tasks, that is, active processing and passive recall of visual versus sequential-spatial versus simultaneous-spatial versus verbal tasks. The battery consisted of a number of tests already used in previous studies and new tests developed to examine specific components of working memory. We analysed the psychometric characteristics of the tests, the correlations amongst measured variables and estimated the measured variables with structural equation modelling in children attending third and fourth grades. Results revealed that the best model was composed of a specific verbal factor, three visuospatial passive factors (sequential-spatial, simultaneous-spatial, and visual) and one visuospatial active factor.}

Groups were matched on reading decoding performance and verbal intelligence. Besides statistical significance testing, we used bootstrap confidence interval estimation and computed effect sizes. Children were individually tested with six computerized tasks, two for each visuospatial WM subcomponent. We found that both MLD and LMA children had low visuospatial WM function in both spatial-simultaneous and spatial-sequential WM tasks. The WM deficit was most expressed in MLD children and less in LMA children. This suggests that WM scores are distributed along a continuum with TD children achieving top scores and MLD children achieving low scores. The theoretical and practical significance of findings is discussed. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject? Working memory plays an important role in mathematical achievement. Children with mathematical learning disability (MLD) usually have low working memory resources. Conflicting results have been reported concerning the role of VSWM in individuals with MLD. What the present study adds? Children with different degree of impairment in math achievement and typically developing children were tested. Visual, spatial-sequential, and spatial-simultaneous working memory tasks were examined. Only spatial-sequential and spatial-simultaneous working memory tasks discriminated the two impairments groups.},

  abstract = {Children with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to experience peer problems compared to their non-ADHD peers, though ADHD-specific symptoms only partially explain this association. This study examined whether sleep difficulties and motor coordination problems are additional predictors of peer problems in an ADHD population. An ADHD sample of 72 participants aged 6–14 years (M = 9.86 years, SD = 1.79 years) was evaluated for an association of peer problems with measures of motor coordination, sleep difficulties as well as ADHD and comorbidity symptoms. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis (HMRA) was used to test the current study aims. Motor coordination, but not sleep difficulties, predicted additional variance in peer problems after controlling for inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, internalizing problems, oppositionality, and conduct problems. Poor motor coordination predicts peer problems beyond ADHD symptoms. Clinicians seeking to improve peer functioning in children with ADHD should also consider motor coordination difficulties in addition to existing treatment strategies. Statement of contribution What is already known Children with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience greater peer problems (i.e., making friends, being victimized, participating in play) than their typically developing peers. Previous studies have attributed this association between ADHD and peer problems to the symptoms of ADHD (i.e., inattention and/or hyperactivity) disrupting the typical trajectory of social development. However, quantitative studies have identified that symptoms of ADHD predict only portion of the variance in a child’s peer problems – highlighting that there may be other unique factors that contribute to the higher incidence of peer problems typically observed in this population. What this study adds This study tested whether additional theoretically relevant factors could predict levels of peer problems in children with ADHD beyond the primary symptoms of the disorder. Internalizing symptomatology, conduct problems, oppositionality, motor coordination, and sleep difficulties were added to a regression model already including inattention and hyperactivity symptoms. These factors explained 51\% of the variability in peer problems. In this sample of 72 ADHD children, the results of the final model highlighted that only motor coordination and conduct problems remained significant predictors of peer problems – highlighting two potentially important target areas for screening and intervention.},

Los bebés realizaron mayoritariamente acciones espontáneas (con o sin vocalizaciones). Luego, clasificamos las acciones (con o sin vocalizaciones) en: convencionales (pasar la página, señalar) o manipulativas (morder, sacudir los libros); otras no orientadas (tomar otro objeto, mirar fuera del escenario). Encontramos que las acciones fueron principalmente manipulativas. Finalmente, clasificamos las acciones en: inespecíficas (morder el libro, sacudirlo) u orientadas (intentar agarrar los objetos representados). Predominaron las acciones inespecíficas. Los hallazgos muestran bebés sensoriomotores en exploración. Sin embargo, algunas intervenciones revelaron también un incipiente desarrollo simbólico al usar los libros convencionalmente y reconocer las imágenes como objetos simbólicos. La lectura compartida es un escenario en el que se accede a diversos sistemas de representación (imágenes, números, letras), permitiendo desarrollar tempranamente un potencial simbólico en contextos sociales relevantes.},

A total of 271 17-year-olds and 215 university students were given one of a series of four paper-and-pencil tests. The results indicated that the effect of belief on reasoning is greater among adolescents for logical forms having a valid conclusion (valid forms), but that belief-bias is greater among adults for logical forms with no valid conclusion (invalid forms). The activation procedure significantly improved performance both among adolescents and among adults, although the effects were limited. Finally, a relation was found between subjects' explicit knowledge of the empirical-logical distinction and their ability to reason with an abstract problem. The results were interpreted as indicating that the effect of belief on reasoning is not linear but involves a complex relation between reasoning Competence and task difficulty.}

  abstract = {While the development of self-recognition in a mirror by toddlers is well documented, less is known about how the presence of a mirror affects young children’s behaviour. Here, we explored how the presence of a mirror affected 2.5- to 3.5-year-olds’ behaviour in a gift-delay task. Behaviour was assessed for a five-minute test period during which children sat in front of a gift bag that was not to be touched until an experimenter returned. Transgressive behaviour by adults is reduced in the presence of a mirror, so we hypothesized that children faced with a mirror would be less likely to touch the gift than children tested without a mirror. We found that the mirror reduced transgressions in children starting from around 3 years of age. We conclude that the presence of a mirror facilitated self-monitoring in 3-year-old children, such that deviations from a behavioural standard are noticed and corrected immediately. Statement of contribution What is already known on the subject? Children’s self-recognition in a mirror has been well documented. Adults’ behaviour can be affected by the presence of a mirror. There is a lack of research investigating how the presence of a mirror affects young children’s behaviour. What does this study add? We show that the presence of a mirror decreases young children’s likelihood to transgress in a gift-delay task. This effect appears to emerge at around three years of age. These findings raise interesting questions regarding the development of self-awareness and how it relates to other mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The trait emotional intelligence (trait EI or trait emotional self-efficacy) framework provides comprehensive coverage of emotion-related self-perceptions and dispositions. In this study, we investigated the relationship between trait EI and four distinct socioemotional criteria on a sample of Dutch adolescents (N = 282; 136 girls, 146 boys; mean age = 13.75 years). As hypothesized, trait EI was positively associated with adaptive coping styles and negatively associated with depressive thoughts and frequency of somatic complaints. It was also negatively associated with maladaptive coping styles, in boys only. Adolescents with high trait EI scores received more nominations from their classmates for being co-operative and girls gave significantly more nominations to classmates with high trait EI scores for having leadership qualities. The discussion focusses on the operationalization of trait emotional self-efficacy in adolescents.}

  abstract = {Two studies were used to examine the collecting behaviour of preschool children. Prior studies of collecting have defined the behaviour as exhibited by older children and adults. To understand childhood collecting, existing theoretical perspectives were discussed in terms of how they might apply to children's behaviour as collectors. Results showed that some preschool children are motivated to engage in collecting and possess the developmental capacities required for successful collecting. Individual differences in executive functioning (Study 1, N= 57) and theory of mind (Study 2, N= 46) explained why some preschoolers were more oriented towards collecting than others. Study 2 showed that the motivational pull of collectible toys can be very strong, with some children agreeing to pay the ‘cost’ of sharing with a confederate child in order to obtain a collectible toy. This research highlights similarities and differences between adult and child collecting. Suggestions are provided for parents and for policy considerations regarding the appropriateness of marketing collectible toys to preschoolers.}

On a ToM battery that included tests of false belief, appearance-reality (AR) and pretend representation, children who had at least 1 child-aged sibling scored significantly higher than both only children and those whose only siblings were infants or adults. The numbers of child-aged siblings in preschoolers' families positively predicted their scores on both a ToM battery (4 tasks) and an EF battery (2 tasks), and these associations remained significant with language ability partialled out. Results of a hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that independent contributions to individual differences in ToM were made by language ability, EF skill and having a child-aged sibling. However, even though some conditions for mediation were met, there was no statistically reliable evidence that EF skills mediated the advantage of presence of child-aged siblings for ToM performance. While consistent with the theory that distinctively childish interaction among siblings accelerates the growth of both ToM and EF capacities, alternative evidence and alternative theoretical interpretations for the findings were also considered.}

  abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the approach to lexical diversity assessment known as the measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD). The index for this approach is calculated as the mean length of word strings that maintain a criterion level of lexical variation. To validate the MTLD approach, we compared it against the performances of the primary competing indices in the field, which include vocd-D, TTR, Maas, Yule’s K, and an HD-D index derived directly from the hypergeometric distribution function. The comparisons involved assessments of convergent validity, divergent validity, internal validity, and incremental validity. The results of our assessments of these indices across two separate corpora suggest three major findings. First, MTLD performs well with respect to all four types of validity and is, in fact, the only index not found to vary as a function of text length. Second, HD-D is a viable alternative to the vocd-D standard. And third, three of the indices—MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas—appear to capture unique lexical information. We conclude by advising researchers to consider using MTLD, vocd-D (or HD-D), and Maas in their studies, rather than any single index, noting that lexical diversity can be assessed in many ways and each approach may be informative as to the construct under investigation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Prior work has conceptualized children's executive function and self‐regulation skills as relatively stable across short periods of time. Grounded in long‐standing contextual theories of human development, this study introduces a new observational tool for measuring children's regulatory skills across different naturally occurring situations within early childhood classrooms. Using 460 observations of 91 children (               M               age = 5.54 years) in 16 socio‐demographically diverse Prekindergarten and Kindergarten classrooms, we found that this tool—the               Regulation‐Related Skills Measure               (RRSM)—reliably captured observed dimensions of young children's attention control and inhibitory control, but failed to appropriately represent more “internal” regulatory processes (e.g., working memory). Associations between the RRSM and other measures of children's executive function and self‐regulation (i.e., direct assessments, adult reports) were low to moderate (               r               = 0.03 to 0.44), suggesting these tools are likely to be complementary in that they provide overlapping but ultimately distinct information regarding children's regulatory performance. Finally, results suggested substantial within‐child variation in regulatory behaviors across different situations within the classroom, with the same children demonstrating consistently stronger attention control and inhibitory control during transitions than during either teacher‐ or student‐directed activities. These findings underscore the situationally‐dependent nature of children's self‐regulatory performance, with implications for both theory and practice. Future research is needed to replicate these findings in more diverse, representative samples of children.},

  abstract = {The ability to infer mental and affective states of others is crucial for social functioning. This ability, denoted as Theory of Mind (ToM), develops rapidly during childhood, yet results on its development across adolescence and into young adulthood are rare. In the present study, we tested the two-component model, measuring age-related changes in social-perceptual and social-cognitive ToM in a sample of 267 participants between 11 and 25 years of age. Additionally, we measured language, reasoning, and inhibitory control as major covariates. Participants inferred mental states from non-verbal cues in a social-perceptual task (Eye Test) and from stories with faux pas in a social-cognitive task (Faux Pas Test). Results showed substantial improvement across adolescence in both ToM measures and in the covariates. Analysis with linear mixed models (LMM) revealed specific age-related growth for the social-perceptual component, while the age-related increase of the social-cognitive component fully aligned with the increase of the covariates. These results support the distinction between ToM components and indicate that adolescence is a crucial period for developing social-perceptual ToM abilities. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? To date, much research has been dedicated to Theory of Mind (ToM) development in early and middle childhood. However, only a few studies have examined development of ToM in adolescence. Studies so far suggest age-related differences in ToM between adolescents and young adults. What this study adds The study offers several methodological advantages including a large sample size with a continuous distribution of age (age 11–25) and the use of a comprehensive test battery to assess ToM and covariates (language, executive functions, reasoning). The results provide evidence for asymmetries in the development of two ToM components (social-perceptual and social-cognitive; the two-component account) across the studied age range: the social perceptual component showed specific development, while the age-related increase of the social-cognitive component fully aligned with increase of the covariates. Adolescence is a crucial period for developing social-perceptual ToM abilities.},

Participants were 43 (27 secure and 16 insecure) 21/2-year-olds, whose security of attachment had been assessed in infancy. No differences were found in the sophistication of solo symbolic play between the secure and insecure groups, but the securely attached children were better able to incorporate an experimenter's suggestions into their sequences of pretence. In addition, the securely attached children were found to have greater ‘executive capacity’ scores (Belsky, Garduque \& Hrncir, 1984). These data show that securely attached children are better able to benefit from the play suggestions of an unfamiliar adult, and thus extend the findings of Slade (1987) on maternal enhancement of children's play. The relationship between security of attachment and response to suggestions for symbolic play is discussed within a Vygotskian framework, and the possibility that these results are evidence for the greater social responsiveness and flexibility of securely attached children is addressed.}

The current study explores how parental behaviour (sensitivity and non-intrusiveness) and the use of parental language (exploring and control languages) correlate with parent–child dyadic mutuality. Specifically, we investigated the following questions: (1) ‘Is parental language associated with parent–child dyadic mutuality above and beyond parental behaviour?’ (2) ‘Does parental language moderate the links between parental behaviour and the parent–child dyadic mutuality?’ (3) ‘Do these differences vary between mothers and fathers?’ The sample included 65 children (Mage = 1.97 years, SD = 0.86) and their parents. We observed parental behaviour, parent–child dyadic mutuality, and the type of parental language used during videotaped in-home observations. The results indicated that parental language and behaviours are distinct components of the parent–child interaction. Parents who used higher levels of exploring language showed higher levels of parent–child dyadic mutuality, even when accounting for parental behaviour. Use of controlling language, however, was not found to be related to the parent–child dyadic mutuality. Different moderation models were found for mothers and fathers. These results highlight the need to distinguish parental language and behaviour when assessing their contribution to the parent–child relationship.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to investigate: (1) the influence of gender, sibling age, and sibling gender on sibling bullying and victimization; (2) the links between personality characteristics, quality of the sibling relationship, and sibling bullying/victimization; (3) the association between sibling and school bullying/victimization, and the direct and indirect associations between personality variables and school bullying/victimization. The sample comprised 195 children (98 boys and 97 girls, aged 10–12 years). Instruments included: a self-report questionnaire for bullying and victimization, the Big Five Questionnaire for Children and the Sibling Inventory of Behaviour. Results highlighted that the presence of an older brother is a risk factor for the emergence of sibling victimization. For both boys and girls, high levels of conflict in the dyad and low levels of empathy were significantly related to sibling bullying and sibling victimization. For males, energy was associated with sibling bullying and indirectly to school bullying; friendliness and high emotional instability were directly associated with school bullying. School victimization was directly associated with emotional instability for both males and females. Finally, both sibling bullying and sibling victimization were associated with bullying and victimization at school. The discussion highlights the role of a multi-contextual approach to understand and prevent bullying.}

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate moral aspects and human values in traditional bullying and cyberbullying, in order to detect differences between the two types of bullying and to test the role of immoral and disengaged behaviours in mediating the relationships between personal values and involvement in bullying. Sample comprised 390 adolescents aged 14–18, balanced for gender, attending different high schools. Traditional and cyberbullying were detected by means of two self-report measures, while the Portrait Values Questionnaire was used to assess 10 values in four dimensions according to the value system model by Schwartz (1992): self-trascendence, self-enhancement, openness to change, and conservation. Finally, immoral and disengaged behaviours were assessed by means of five items about behavioural and personal aspects salient for morality. Results showed that, irrespective of gender, self-enhancement and self-trascendence moderately predicted cyber and traditional bullying, respectively, while immoral and disengaged behaviours predicted both. Indirect effects showed that self-enhancement and openness to change predicted both forms of bullying through immoral behaviour. Results are discussed in terms of similarities and differences between cyber and traditional bullying and with attention to the central role of morality in explaining bullying nature.}

Four groups of 20 subjects (deaf readers, hearing good readers, poor readers and young readers) matched on sex, intelligence and chronological or reading age participated in two experiments. Experiment 1 examined orthographic regularity effects and non-word pronounceability effects and revealed that deaf readers, like good hearing readers, access the meanings of words through visual mechanisms but that those mechanisms are slower and less accurate than those of their hearing counterparts. Further, the results suggested that, unlike young readers, deaf readers do not appear to use the facility of the phonological route to the lexicon for reading low frequency exception words. Nevertheless, the deaf were observed to activate phonological information for decoding pronounceable non-words, but more slowly than their matched good readers. Experiment 2 varied the reliance upon visual features of words by examining regularity effects for words presented in upper-case and lower-case letters. Results indicated that deaf readers spontaneously used visual mechanisms for the recognition of low frequency exception words to provide fast but inaccurate responses. In contrast the good readers, poor readers and young readers accessed the meanings of those words through phonological processes.}

  abstract = {Even in a simple task such as drawing a circle, a graphic production rule governs the syntactical aspects of the movement sequence. The lawful relationship between starting position and rotational direction in circle production has been described as the start-rotation principle. The principle states that when subjects start drawing a circle at the top, it is most likely that they will use a counterclockwise rotational movement. When subjects start drawing a circle at the bottom, however, they will almost certainly use a clockwise rotational movement. The origin of the principle has been attributed to biomechanical differences between extension and flexion movements, planning activities prior to the initiation of the movements to set the upper limit of circles in space, and cultural factors such as the predominance of the counterclockwise rotational direction in cursive script. The latter, rather global, explanation of the start-rotation principle has been rejected on the ground that the principle holds for both children and adults, showing that it is not susceptible to development or training. We presently report observations of children's circle productions which do not support the latter argument. Our findings show that, although the start-rotation principle indeed governs circular movements of young children to some extent, the principle clearly becomes stronger with increasing age. We raise an alternative explanation of the start-rotation principle which is concerned with end-point accuracy and the role of visually monitoring trajectory formation. We tested our views in a control experiment with adult subjects.}

  abstract = {Previous research demonstrates that from early in life, our cortical sensorimotor areas are activated both when performing and when observing actions (mirroring). Recent findings suggest that the adult motor system is also involved in detecting others’ rule violations. Yet, how this translates to everyday action errors (e.g., accidentally dropping something) and how error-sensitive motor activity for others’ actions emerges are still unknown. In this study, we examined the role of the motor system in error monitoring. Participants observed successful and unsuccessful pincer grasp actions while their electroencephalography was registered. We tested infants (8- and 14-month-olds) at different stages of learning the pincer grasp and adults as advanced graspers. Power in Alpha- and Beta-frequencies was analysed to assess motor and visual processing. Adults showed enhanced motor activity when observing erroneous actions. However, neither 8- nor 14-month-olds displayed this error sensitivity, despite showing motor activity for both actions. All groups did show similar visual activity, that is more Alpha-suppression, when observing correct actions. Thus, while correct and erroneous actions were processed as visually distinct in all age groups, only the adults’ motor system was sensitive to action correctness. Functionality of different brain oscillations in the development of error monitoring and mirroring is discussed.},

Early numerical skills were conceptualized as quantity-number competencies (QNC) at both basic (QNC Level 1) and advanced (QNC Level 2) levels. In a sample of 1,343 children aged 5 and 6, structural equation modelling provided support for the isolated number words hypothesis (Krajewski \& Schneider, 2009, J. Exp. Child Psychol., 103, 516–531). This hypothesis claims that phonological awareness contributes to the acquisition of QNC Level 1, such as learning the number word sequence, but not of QNC Level 2, which requires the linkage of number words to quantities. In addition, phonological awareness relied on verbal working memory, especially with regard to the phonological loop, central executive, and episodic buffer. The results were congruent with the idea that phonological awareness mediates the impact of verbal working memory on QNCs. The relationships between verbal working memory, phonological awareness, and QNCs were comparable in monolingual and bilingual children.},

Survey data from a diverse college sample of 220 emerging adults (M age ≈ 23, 175 women) were collected and analysed using a series of multiple regressions. Results revealed that emerging adults high in general identity coherence (indicative of high self-concept clarity) reported presenting the real self and the ideal self on Facebook, suggesting that they were more truthful and positively realistic in their online self-presentation. Emerging adults high in general identity confusion (indicative of less self-concept clarity) reported presenting the ideal self and the false self on Facebook, suggesting that they were less truthful, less realistic, and more socially desirable in their online self-presentation. Moreover, emerging adults who experienced both identity coherence and identity confusion reported presenting the false self on Facebook motivated by self-exploration. Emerging adults experiencing high social anxiety reported presenting the false self on Facebook; they engaged in an extensive self-exploratory and socially desirable online self-presentation. Further, emerging adults experiencing both high identity confusion and high social anxiety reported presenting themselves on Facebook in a less truthful manner. Findings have important implications for identity integration during the emerging adulthood transition in the digital age.},

Four groups were compared in a two contingency treatments (contingent, yoked) × two risk status design. Concurrent heart rate was monitored during three phases of a contingency learning task (baseline, contingency/stimulation, extinction) and analysis focused on phase transitions. Non-risk babies presented with contingent stimulation showed an immediate increase in cardiac rate associated with a subsequent response increase to the contingency. Risk infants presented with contingent stimulation showed delayed cardiac reactivity accompanied by a smaller response increase to the contingency. Yoked controls decreased responding in the contingent period with no significant changes in cardiac reactivity at phase transitions. The findings of the study are discussed in relation to individual differences in physiological regulation and to differential sensitization in a contingency learning task.}

  abstract = {We review evidence relating to children's ability to acknowledge false beliefs within a simulation account according to which our focus is set by default to the world as we know it: hence, our current beliefs assume salience over beliefs that do not fall into this category. The model proposes that the ease with which we imaginatively shift from this default depends on the salience of our current belief, relative to the salience of the belief that is being simulated. However, children do use a rule-based approach for mentalizing in some contexts, which has the advantage of protecting them from the salience of their own belief. Rule-based mentalizing judgements might be faster, cognitively easier and less prone to error, relative to simulation-based judgements that are much influenced by salience. We propose that although simulation is primary, rule-based approaches develop as a shortcut; we thus grow from individuals capable of using only simulation into individuals capable of both techniques.}

An adult entered the room searching for an object. One candidate object was out in the open, whereas another was visible for the child but behind an occluder from the adult's perspective. When asked to help the adult find the sought-for object, 24-month-old children, but not 18-month-old children, handed him the occluded object (whereas in a control condition they showed no preference for the occluded toy). We argue that the performance of the 24-month-olds requires Level 1 visual perspective-taking skills and that this is the youngest age at which these skills have been demonstrated.}

Against this background, the link between EF and disruptive behaviours in kindergarteners was investigated using a carefully selected battery of EF measures. Three groups of kindergarteners were compared: (1) a group combining high levels of disruptive behaviours and ADHD symptoms (COMB); (2) a group presenting high levels of disruptive/aggressive behaviours and low levels of ADHD symptoms (AGG); and (3) a normative group (NOR). Children in the COMB and AGG groups presented weaker inhibition capacities compared with normative peers. Also, only the COMB group showed weaker working memory capacities compared with the NOR group. Results support the idea that preschool children with DBD have weaker inhibition capacities and that this weakness could be common to both ADHD and DBD.},

Participants were shown/read 17 different cartoon scenarios and were asked if each constituted an episode of bullying or not. Multidimensional scaling indicated that the groups differed in their definition of bullying. 4- to 6-year-olds and 8-year-olds used 1 dimension, a distinction between aggressive and non-aggressive acts, when differentiating cartoons; 14-year-olds and adults gave a 2-dimensional solution, also distinguishing between physical and non-physical (social/relational or verbal) acts. Study 2 further investigated definitions of bullying given by 99 children aged 4 to 6 years, and the role of experience. Just over half had some understanding of the term, but tended to be less concerned about power differences and repetition of actions. No significant differences in definitions were found between boys and girls, or between children in involved (aggressor, victim or defender) or not involved (bystander) roles; however, aggressors were more likely than other children to say that 11 of the 13 aggressive behaviours were not bullying. These findings are discussed in relation to age related changes in experiences of bullying and cognitive development. Implications for interventions and research are also raised.}

  abstract = {The present research was designed to highlight the relation between children's categorical knowledge and their verbal short-term memory (STM) performance. To do this, we manipulated the categorical organization of the words composing lists to be memorized by 5- and 9-year-old children. Three types of word list were drawn up: semantically similar context-dependent (CD) lists, semantically similar context-independent (CI) lists, and semantically dissimilar lists. In line with the procedure used by Poirier and Saint-Aubin (1995), the dissimilar lists were produced using words from the semantically similar lists. Both 5- and 9-year-old children showed better recall for the semantically similar CD lists than they did for the unrelated lists. In the semantic similar CI condition, semantic similarity enhanced immediate serial recall only at age 9 but contributed to item information memory both at ages 5 and 9. These results, which indicate a semantic influence of long-term memory (LTM) on serial recall from age 5, are discussed in the light of current models of STM. Moreover, we suggest that differences between results at 5 and 9 years are compatible with pluralist models of development.}

  abstract = {Pre-term birth has a significant impact on infants' social and emotional competence, however, little is known about regulatory processes in pre-term mother-infant dyads during normal or stressful interactions. The primary goals of this study were to investigate the differences in infant and caregiver interactive behaviour and dyadic coordination of clinically healthy pre-term compared to full-term infant-mother dyads and to examine pre-term infants' capacity for coping with stress using the face-to-face still-face paradigm (FFSF). Fifty mother-infant dyads, including 25 pre-term infants and 25 full-term infants were videotaped during the FFSF. All infants were 6–9 months of age (corrected for gestational age in the pre-term group). Infant and maternal socio-emotional expressivity and self-regulatory behaviours were coded and measures of dyadic coordination (Matching, Reparation Rate, and Synchrony) were calculated. There were no significant differences in infant and caregiver socio-emotional behaviours between the two groups and both groups demonstrated the still-face (SF) effect and the reunion effect. There was a difference in self-regulatory behaviour. Pre-term infants were more likely than full-term infants to use distancing (e.g., by turning away, twisting, or arching) from their mothers during the FFSF. Additionally, during the Reunion episode of the FFSF pre-term infants showed more social monitoring compared to full-term infants. Regardless of the birth status, the dyads showed less coordination and a slower rate of reparation during the Reunion episode than during the Play episode. The higher proportion of distancing in the pre-term group and the increase in social monitoring suggest that even in normal interactions pre-term infants may experience a higher level of stress and have less capacity for self-regulation compared to the full-terms and that pre-term infants appear to use a compensatory strategy of increased social monitoring to cope with the stress of renegotiating the interaction during Reunion. The findings suggest that pre-term infants have different regulatory and interactive capacities than full-term infants.}

Eight totally blind children and eight children whose vision was severely impaired were visited at home at around 18 months of age and video-recordings were made of each child interacting with a familiar caretaker. It was found that the parents of blind children were more likely to initiate interactions themselves and tended to use verbal comments unaccompanied by actions more frequently. They were less likely to talk about objects which were at the child's current focus of attention and were more likely to describe the properties of objects to the child using general terms such as pronouns or general nouns. In addition, they tended to request verbal information from their children in contrast to the parents of severely visually impaired children, who were more likely to describe objects for them. Children in both groups received more requests for action than any other utterance type and all parents made infrequent mention of the attributes of objects. The differences between the groups are discussed in terms of the difficulties faced particularly by parents of blind children in initiating and sustaining interactions.}

  abstract = {Manual search for totally occluded objects was investigated in 10-, 12- and 14-month old infants. Infants responded to two types of total hiding in different ways, supporting the inference that object permanence is not a once-and-for-all attainment. Occlusion of an object by movement of a screen over it was solved at an earlier age than occlusion in which an object was carried under the screen. This dissociation was not explained by motivation, motor skill or means-ends coordination, because for both tasks the same object was hidden in the same place under the same screen and required the same uncovering response. This dissociation generalized across an experimentally manipulated change in recovery means-infants removed cloths while seated at a table in Expt 1 and were required to crawl through 3-D space to displace semi-rigid pillows in Expt 2. Further analysis revealed that emotional response varied as a function of hiding, suggesting an affective correlate of infant cognition. There are four empirical findings to account for: developmental change, task dissociation, generalization of the effects across recovery means, and emotional reactions. An identity-development theory is proposed explaining these findings in terms of infants’ understanding of object identity and the developmental relationship between object identity and object permanence. Object identity is seen as a necessary precursor to the development of object permanence.}

Children completed the Children's Anger and Sadness Management Scales (Zeman, Shipman, \& Penza-Clyve, 2001) to assess emotion management (i.e., effortful control, over control, under control). Comparisons across nations indicated that Ghanaian youth reported more overt anger expression than youth from Kenya and the United States and less anger inhibition than Kenyan youth. U.S. children reported less overt expression and more constraint over sadness than Kenyan and Ghanaian children, although Kenyans reported being calmer when experiencing sadness than Ghanaian and American youth. Comparing Ghanaian regional contexts, village children reported more anger control than urban children. Regardless of nationality, boys reported more control over sadness than girls who reported more under control of sadness and more over control of anger than boys. Future research is needed to build on these descriptive, preliminary findings examining under-studied cross-national contexts.}

A specific focus was the extent to which these influences change with age during adolescence (13–17 years). Normative influences on smoking behaviour increased up to age 15–16 years and then declined. This curvilinear pattern seems largely due to the rise and decline of peer influences over these years. On the other hand, the influence of parents (both in terms of parental example and approval) is constant over this period. Beliefs about the consequences of smoking were also affected by age. The distinctive contribution of such beliefs to the prediction of smoking doubled during the years under consideration. These results have important implications for the understanding of susceptibility to social influence during adolescence and for the design of effective smoking prevention programmes.}

Another task, in which children have to differentiate the drawing of a kangaroo from that of a person, is also considered. According to a neo-Piagetian model of drawing development (Morra, 1995), it is hypothesized that three factors underlie children's ability to flexibly modify their drawings: (a) the amount of attentional resources (M capacity) that a child can use to activate task-relevant figurative and operative schemes; (b) automatic activation of figurative schemes from perceptual input that can be obtained by presenting a model; and (c) activation of executive schemes that set appropriate goals and monitor performance, which can be obtained by manipulating contextual variables, such as task order. Three experiments (with a total of 645 participants in the age range from 5 to 9 years) tested successfully the theoretical predictions about the causal factors of drawing flexibility.}

Participants were also tested for M capacity and field independence. The results showed a pattern of relationships between M capacity and partial occlusion drawing, exactly consistent with the predictions derived from Morra, Angi, and Tomat's (1996) model. As predicted, field independence was also related to partial occlusion drawing. A detailed analysis of field independence scores revealed that, out of three measures (rod-and-frame, children's embedded figures test, and block design), only embedded figures showed a relationship with drawings that was still significant when M capacity and the other two field independence measures were partialled out. Following PascualLeone's (1989) neo-Piagetian model of field independence, this divergence among tests was interpreted as an indication of a figurative misleading field effect in the partial occlusion drawing task.}

We replicated the correlation between emotion comprehension and grammar comprehension, and found that working memory capacity correlates with both of these variables (also with age statistically controlled). The significant effect of age on emotion comprehension was eliminated when working memory capacity was co-varied. In a regression analysis of emotion comprehension scores, when working memory capacity was entered as a predictor, no additional variance was significantly accounted for by grammar comprehension, gender, or age. A structural relations model, in which the paths from working memory capacity to emotion comprehension and from working memory capacity to grammar comprehension account fully for the correlation between grammar and emotion comprehension, fit the data well. However, working memory capacity was not equally related to all components of the Test of Emotion Comprehension (TEC) (Pons \& Harris, 2000), the relationship being significant only for some of them. In particular, working memory capacity has a decisive role in the transition from understanding external to mental aspects of emotions. It is concluded that the development of working memory has a considerable impact on the development of emotion comprehension.}

The second goal was to examine the specificity of the relation between false belief understanding and counterfactual reasoning after controlling for age and working memory ability. One hundred, 3- to 6-year-old, children were administered two measures of false belief understanding (two versions of the unexpected contents task and two versions of the unexpected locations task), two measures of counterfactual reasoning and a working memory measure. Results showed that performance on the unexpected contents task did not significantly differ across conditions. However, only the conditions of the unexpected contents task that concerned another person's false belief correlated significantly with the unexpected locations task. Moreover, counterfactual reasoning was found to explain a significant amount of variance in the unexpected locations task, even after controlling for age and working memory performance. Findings are discussed in the context of different accounts of the development of theory of mind, and in the context of different interpretations of the relation between false belief understanding and counterfactual reasoning.}

  abstract = {Parents are increasingly expected to supplement their children's school-based learning by providing support for children's homework. However, parents' capacities to provide such support may vary and may be limited by the experience of depression. This may have implications for child development. In the course of a prospective, longitudinal study of children of postnatally depressed and healthy mothers, we observed mothers (N=88) and fathers (N=78) at home during maths homework interactions with their 8-year-old children. The quality of parental communication was rated and analysed in relation to child functioning. The quality of communication of each of the parents was related to their mental state, social class and IQ. While postnatal depression was not directly related to child development, there was some evidence of the influence of maternal depression occurring in the child's school years. Different aspects of parental communication with the child showed specific associations with different child outcomes, over and above the influence of family characteristics. In particular, child school attainment and IQ were associated with parental strategies to encourage representational thinking and mastery motivation, whereas child behavioural adjustment at school and self-esteem were linked to the degree of parental emotional support and low levels of coercion. Notably, the influence of maternal homework support was more strongly related to child outcome than was paternal support, a pattern reflected in mothers' greater involvement in children's schools and school-related activities. Some parents may need guidance in how to support their children's homework if it is to be of benefit to child functioning.}

  abstract = {The present work intends to thoroughly identify theoretical and practical applications of self-regulation (SR) in contemporary developmental research, by reviewing conceptual and operational definitions of SR, in addition to the methods and instruments used to assess it in empirical studies. This review focuses on answering the question of what SR is and how is it measured. 468 scientific articles with cumulative evidence from the last two decades of research were included (142 reviews and 326 original research articles). Utilizing a mixed-methods approach based on grounded theory methodology, the main theoretical and methodological aspects involved in the definition and operationalization of SR were reviewed. Results point towards a growing consensus in the conceptual definition of SR, primarily stemming from the Executive Functions and Effortful Control frameworks, which emphasize the interrelation of emotional and cognitive control, goal-oriented activity, physiological and interpersonal processes. Empirical research often attends to diverse biologic, behavioral and social features in the operationalization of the concept, making use of report scales, performance tasks and, to a lesser extent, physiological and observational measurements.}

While most of the cerebral cortex and ventral mesencephalic astroglial cell population was responsive at all ages tested, striatal cells at E14 and E17 were not. At age E21 striatal astroglia showed a signi®cant shift toward a mature-like type of response to cyclic AMP. Postnatal striatal astroglia responded to cyclic AMP as the cortical and ventral mesencephalic astroglia did, with generalized stellation. Prenatal striatal astroglia was characterized immunocytochemically as A2B5+, ®bronectin+, vimentin+, S-100+ and GFAPÀ. Failure of early prenatal (E14, E17) striatal astroglia to dierentiate in response to cyclic AMP, was overcome by previous (5±7 days) co-culture with primary cell dissociates from postnatal-, but not from prenatal donors, from all brain regions tested including a non-target region for striatal cells, such as septum. This eect was duplicated when striatal astroglia was co-cultured with cell populations enriched in neurons through Percoll gradients. Only cell-to-cell contact co-cultures were able to induce a change in the studied response. Dead neuron-enriched populations obtained following various types of physical treatments were also able to change signi®cantly striatal cell response toward cyclic AMP. Enriched astroglial populations from postnatal donors did not change striatal astroglial response toward cyclic AMP, except for ventral mesencephalic astroglia which induced a comparatively reduced but signi®cant increase in striatal cell responsiveness. It is concluded that astroglial maturation and potential for phenotype expression during brain development proceeds with regional heterochrony. Also, that maturation of prenatal striatal astroglia responsiveness toward cyclic AMP is inducible by nondiusible factors, probably of neuronal origin, expressed in live or dead primary cultures from various, homotopic and heterotopic, postnatal brain regions. It is further suggested that striatal aerents and/or mature local striatal neurons express membrane associated molecules that regulate responsiveness for phenotype expression of striatal glial cells, thus reinforcing the concept of a highly interactive, continuous neuron-glial developmental process that takes place during brain organization. 7 2000 ISDN.

An exploratory interview study (N=17) was carried out to assess children's verbal responses to both alcohol and non-alcohol advertisements and to elicit vocabulary to be used in the second study. Whilst the 7–8 years old children were very positive about the alcohol advertisements, older children did not like them, nor did they perceive them to be effective. The second study was designed to assess children's implicit knowledge, in view of developmental theory that knowledge is not always available for verbal report. This study (N=179) used a simple categorization programme on computer. Using this methodology, children of all ages liked the alcohol advertisements and perceived them as effective. Advertising styles affected popularity with humour, cartoon format or the inclusion of an animal, or character increasing the appeal of an advertisement. The discussion draws attention to the importance of multiple methodologies in eliciting valid and accurate information from children, and to policy matters with regard to alcohol advertising regulation.}

We found that the relation between mobile media use and EC was moderated by children's sleep time. Tablet use was negatively related to EC only among children who slept less at night (40\% of our sample). However, hand-held game player use was positively related to EC among children who slept longer at night (60\% of our sample). In addition, sleep quality was a mediator in the relation between evening tablet use and EC. Evening use related to later bedtimes, more bedtime resistance, and worse sleep duration, and these indicators of poor sleep quality, in turn, predicted weaker EC. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Young children are spending increasing amounts of time with mobile media, such as tablets and hand-held game players. Media exposure is related to children's self-regulation. Media exposure is related to children's sleep quality. What does this study adds? Number of sleep hours moderates the relation between mobile media use and EC among young children. Tablet time is negatively related to EC among young children who get fewer sleep hours. Hand-held game playing is positively related to EC among young children who get greater sleep hours. Sleep quality mediates the relation between evening tablet time and EC among young children.},

From a self‐presentational perspective, social desirability can be regarded as the resultant of two separate factors: self‐deception and other‐deception. Two main modes of coping with social desirability bias are distinguished. The first mode comprises two methods aimed at the detection and measurement of social desirability bias: the use of social desirability scales, and the rating of item desirability. A second category comprises seven methods to prevent or reduce social desirability bias, including the use of forced‐choice items, the randomized response technique, the bogus pipeline, self‐administration of the questionnaire, the selection of interviewers, and the use of proxy subjects. Not one method was found to excel completely and under all conditions in coping with both other‐deceptive and self‐deceptive social desirability bias. A combination of prevention and detection methods offers the best choice available.},

The sample included 72 Hindu Indian children, adolescents and young adults (M ages = 10.2, 15.1 and 19.8 years) from Mysore, India. Participants were presented with a series of vignettes in which the needs and desires of spouses conflicted, designed so that the protagonist in each situation was either a husband or wife. Participants were asked to decide what the actor should do and why, indicating whether personal autonomy or interpersonal responsibility concerns were dominant. A repeated measures MANOVA found a main effect of spousal condition, indicating that judgments were influenced by norms of patriarchy: autonomy was emphasized more often for husbands, responsibility more often for wives (particularly among male children). However, participants also went against cultural norms, with 58\% of participants supporting autonomy for wives when their personal concerns were relatively important. Although Hindu India is often described as a collectivistic culture in which personal concerns are subordinated to interpersonal concerns, the Hindu Indian participants in this study displayed concern with both autonomy and responsibility, and gender hierarchy played a role in the manifestation of these concerns.}

To a minimal group 6-, 8-, and 10-year-old children (N=159) were assigned, and received information, or no information, about the interests and activities of the in-group and out-group members. Results indicated that the in-group was always rated more positively than the out-group, and that the in-group's ratings were unaffected by either the in-group or out-group information. In contrast, out-group ratings were affected by out-group information, but only when there was no information available about the in-group. The implications of the findings for ST, and for social identity development theory, are discussed.}

  abstract = {Background Self-regulation (SR) is central to developmental psychopathology, but progress has been impeded by varying terminology and meanings across fields and literatures. Methods The present review attempts to move that discussion forward by noting key sources of prior confusion such as measurement-concept confounding, and then arguing the following major points. Results First, the field needs a domain-general construct of SR that encompasses SR of action, emotion, and cognition and involves both top-down and bottom-up regulatory processes. This does not assume a shared core process across emotion, action, and cognition, but is intended to provide clarity on the extent of various claims about kinds of SR. Second, top-down aspects of SR need to be integrated. These include (a) basic processes that develop early and address immediate conflict signals, such as cognitive control and effortful control (EC), and (b) complex cognition and strategies for addressing future conflict, represented by the regulatory application of complex aspects of executive functioning. Executive function (EF) and cognitive control are not identical to SR because they can be used for other activities, but account for top-down aspects of SR at the cognitive level. Third, impulsivity, risk-taking, and disinhibition are distinct although overlapping; a taxonomy of the kinds of breakdowns of SR associated with psychopathology requires their differentiation. Fourth, different aspects of the SR universe can be organized hierarchically in relation to granularity, development, and time. Low-level components assemble into high-level components. This hierarchical perspective is consistent across literatures. Conclusions It is hoped that the framework outlined here will facilitate integration and cross-talk among investigators working from different perspectives, and facilitate individual differences research on how SR relates to developmental psychopathology.},

  abstract = {A large proportion of young children spend many hours in early childhood education and care (ECEC) and such care is costly. Given this context, it is important to examine the quality of care children receive, whether they experience quality differently, and the effects of quality on child development. Exposure to high quality ECEC is expected to promote child development. However, results linking ECEC quality to children’s outcomes are mixed. Perhaps researchers need to focus on different aspects of ECEC quality. Alternatively, limitations of the literature may explain this inconsistency, as assessments of ECEC quality often aggregate across individual children to the classroom level, and such research is conducted primarily in the U.S. My two dissertation papers address gaps regarding what impacts quality, children’s differential experiences of quality, and associations between quality and child outcomes. Both papers focus on classrooms serving preschool-aged children.  The first paper is a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the role of educator early childhood specialization on a range of preschool-aged children’s outcomes. Findings from this paper indicate that this quality indicator is not strongly or consistently associated with the outcomes examined in the literature. Limitations of the literature are discussed as possible explanations for the few results. The second paper uses archival data to assess ECEC quality at the child, classroom, and centre levels, by examining whether and why children are differentially treated by ECEC educators. This paper consists of two studies. The first examines educator differential treatment (DT) of children using educator-reports of their perceived closeness and conflict with each child in their classroom. The second examines DT using child-educator observations of social interaction and instruction. Results indicate that individual children have very different experiences in ECEC settings across a range of affective, social, and instructional domains, regardless of how DT is assessed. Educators reported closer and less conflicted relationships with prosocial children and directed more positive support and engagement towards children demonstrating oppositional behaviour. In addition to child behaviour, aspects of classroom quality showed associations with DT, however, results were inconsistent. Implications for public policy, resource allocation, and future research, particularly in Canada, are discussed.},

With a sample of 141 11-year-olds from the Netherlands and Hong Kong, we first examined a broad range of strategies for responding to a provocateur, finding that both Chinese and Dutch children were more likely to use intrapersonal strategies (for coping internally with the angry feelings) than interpersonal responses (to communicate anger to the provocateur). No cultural divergence was shown in the overall extent to which anger would be verbally expressed, but differences became apparent when we asked children precisely what they would say to an aggressor in a hypothetical anger-eliciting situation. As predicted, Chinese children were more likely to react tolerantly to the aggressor than their Dutch peers, whereas Dutch children indicated that they would verbally confront the aggressor more often, trying to reinstate their personal goals. In comparison with Dutch children, the Chinese sample viewed their chosen strategies as more likely to elicit positive reactions from the aggressor and to reduce anger. Directions for further research on the personal and socio-cultural functionality of anger response styles are discussed.}

In our second study, we trained a group of children in logical reasoning and found that they made more progress in mathematics than a control group who were not given this training. These studies establish a causal link between logical reasoning and mathematical learning. Much of children's mathematical knowledge is based on their understanding of its underlying logic.}

  abstract = {Why are some students more engaged in and adjusted to school than others? Why are some students more competent and why do they perform better than others? Self-determination theory is a theory of human motivation to explain students’ classroom behavior, learning process, and relationship with the environment. The goal of this paper is to review the concept of autonomy support in the classroom within the self-determination framework. Autonomy is defined as a form of voluntary action, stemming from a person’s interest and with no external pressure. Social environments that support autonomy provide meaningful rationale, acknowledge negative feelings, use noncontrolling language, offer meaningful choices, and nurture internal motivational resources. In classrooms where teachers support autonomy, students improve their academic performance, are more creative and better adjusted, engage more in school, and feel less stress. We provide theoretical and methodological suggestions for future research.},

A group of skilled comprehenders was compared to a less skilled group on two oral tasks involving because sentences: a questions task and a sentence completion task. For each task, the subjects received deductive items (where because introduces the evidence for a conclusion) and empirical items (where because introduces a cause). The experiment also investigated the effect of modifying the instructions for the deductive items so as to focus the subjects' attention on the source of evidence for a conclusion. Skilled comprehenders performed significantly better than less skilled comprehenders on the deductive, but not on the empirical, items. Performance on deductive items was poorer than that on empirical items. However, scores on the deductive items were increased by the modified instructions.}

  abstract = {This study examines the literacy outcomes for children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds who had received specific whole-class phonological awareness (PA) and language intervention in preschool. The participants were 57 children who had been involved in the original intervention study. Their PA skills, letter-sound knowledge, real word and non-word spelling and reading comprehension were assessed in Grade 2. The results indicated that children who had received intervention in preschool performed similarly to the children who had not received intervention. The gains made in PA and language skills post intervention had failed to augment further literacy development. A post hoc examination of individual student profiles, however, revealed that a subgroup of children who had received intervention had maintained their enhanced performance and that the intervention cohort had similar scores on tests of PA ability to their age-matched peers in the population. It was concluded that whole-class, teacher-delivered, PA and language intervention, while effective in the short term, does not lead to a generalized improvement in literacy skills in Grade 2. Possible reasons for the failure of the program to produce medium term gains are discussed.}

Thus, children’s (N = 157, mean age: 5.9 years) persistent and non-persistent behaviours (i.e., cheating and off-task) were assessed in an unsolvable task. Additionally, we assessed children’s executive functions and temperament. Analysis for persistence showed that cognitive inhibition and cognitive flexibility predicted children’s persistent behaviour, beyond age and temperament. Analyses for non-persistent behaviours revealed that temperament and weak executive functions predicted cheating, while age predicted off-task behaviour. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? So far, persistence has been conceptualized as a temperamental sub-dimension of self-regulation. What does this study add? A child’s persistence depends not only on temperament but also on cognitive inhibition and cognitive flexibility. There are qualitative differences between the two non-persistent behaviours cheating and off-task. While cheating is related to weaker cognitive skills, off-task behaviour seems mainly age-related.},

Specifically, we asked whether children’s intelligence involves both general and specific aspects and whether standard ToM measures of false belief can serve as indicators of social intelligence. Psychometric intelligence and children’s domain-specific understanding of number concepts and of mental states (false belief) were measured in the laboratory; communication and social skills were assessed through mothers’ report. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed poor fit for a one-factor model, but good fit for a model with three correlated factors, suggesting that children’s intelligence involves both general and specific aspects. Numerate-spatial and verbal intelligence were correlated (.70), and social intelligence correlated to a stronger degree with verbal (.66) than with numerate-spatial intelligence (.37). Laboratory assessment of false belief and mothers’ reports about children’s social skills loaded on a single factor, pointing to real-world consequences of ToM abilities. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The structure of intelligence in 4-year-olds comprises domain-general and domain-specific dimensions. Some domain-specific dimensions are numerate-spatial, verbal, and social intelligence. What does this study add? Theory of Mind emerges as an aspect of children’s social intelligence. Social intelligence (including Theory of Mind) is related to children’s numerate-spatial abilities.},

Suggestion-induced false memories were created using a misinformation procedure during which both maltreated and non-maltreated children viewed a negative video (i.e., bank robbery) and later received suggestive misinformation concerning the event. Our results showed that maltreated children had higher levels of spontaneous negative false memories but lower levels of suggestion-induced false memories as compared to non-maltreated children. Collectively, our study demonstrates that maltreatment both increases and decreases susceptibility to memory illusions depending on the type of false memory being induced.

  abstract = {This cross-sequential study investigated the development of phonological recoding in working memory in relation to literacy acquisition in children between the ages of 5 and 8 years. Using a paradigm which manipulates visual and phonological similarity of visual stimuli, it has shown that phonological recoding consists not only of the ability to access the phonological representation of the visual stimuli, but also the capacity to inhibit the visual representation which might cause interference. In relation to literacy acquisition, the ability to access the phonological representation is a unique predictor of literacy acquisition over and above that accounted for by age, intelligence and working memory capacity. It accounts for up to 25\% of the variance on a Neale Analysis of Reading test and up to 18\% of the variance on the WRAT single word reading test. However, from the age of 7 years and above, the capacity to inhibit the visual response also plays a major role, accounting for a further 10\% of the variance. Children of this age who are still relying on visual strategies in working memory have significantly lower literacy attainment levels. There was no significant relation between phonological recoding and maths scores until the age of 8 years, showing that a separable cognitive processing component has been isolated.}

This study examined Baron-Cohen's (1994, 1995) claim that the ability to use eye-gaze plays a crucial role in the child's developing understanding of other minds. Children aged 3 and 4 years participated in a face-reading task, which assessed their capacity to infer mental states from a character's direction of eye-gaze, and in a false-belief task. As predicted, no child passed the false-belief task without prior success on the face-reading task. However, contrary to a central claim within Baron-Cohen's model of mind-reading, presentation of an eye-gaze cue in the false-belief task did not enhance children's performance. Furthermore, children did not solely rely on eye-gaze as a cue, but used another directional cue (an arrow) in inferring a character's desire and intention. These results question the special role of eye-gaze in the child's developing ability to mind-read.}

  abstract = {Some researchers have maintained that blind children show an important delay in their language development, and that blind children's language is ‘aberrant’ or special in certain aspects, including the use of personal pronouns, repetitions, formulas, and unanalysed speech. Consequently, it has been claimed that blind children are less active processors of language than sighted children, and that they rely on rote learning, which determines some of the characteristic features of their language. Data are presented which run counter to this view. These come from a longitudinal study of a blind child and her sighted twin sister. The study began when the children were 2:5 years old and spanned nearly three years. Mean length of utterances, over-regularizations, pronoun errors, pragmatic speech functions, and imitations, repetitions and routines (IRR) were analysed. The results clearly show that the language of the blind child is neither delayed, nor aberrant. Evidence is shown that IRR form part of a mechanism of language analysis, which is specially used by the blind girl, who seems to manifest a Gestalt style of language learning.}

  abstract = {This study investigated two hypotheses regarding the mapping of perception to action during imitation. The first hypothesis predicted that as children's cognitive capacities increase the tendency to map one goal and disregard others during imitation should decrease. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the performances of 168 4- to 7-year-olds in a gestural imitation task developed by Bekkering, Wohlschläger, and Gattis. The second hypothesis predicted that reducing the mapping between perception and action should reduce the demands on the cognitive resources of the child. This hypothesis was tested by creating a condition in which perception and action overlapped by sharing objects between experimenter and child. In three experimental conditions, an adult modelled four gestures, directed at either: 1) one of two sets of round stickers (proprietary objects); 2) the same location on the table, without any sticker (no objects); or 3) one set of round stickers, which were shared with the child (shared objects). The results confirmed both hypotheses. Four- and five-year-olds imitated less accurately when imitation involved mapping of both objects and movements (proprietary and shared objects) than when imitation involved mapping movements only (no objects). Seven-year-olds imitated accurately in all three conditions, demonstrating that increased cognitive capacity allowed them to map multiple goals from perception to action. Most importantly, reducing the mapping between perception and action in the shared objects condition facilitated imitation, specifically for the transitional group, 6-year-olds. We conclude that mapping between perception and action is not direct, but resembles mapping relations in analogical reasoning: cognitive processes mediate mapping from perception to action.}

Ninety-three children (33 deaf; 60 hearing) aged 3–13 years were tested on a set of six closely matched ToM tasks. Results showed that deaf children were delayed substantially behind hearing children in understanding pretending, false belief (FB) and other ToM concepts, in line with their delayed uptake of social pretend (SP) play. By using a scaling methodology, we confirmed previous evidence of a consistent five-step developmental progression for both groups. Moreover, by including social pretence understanding, both deaf and hearing children's ToM sequences were shown to extend reliably to six sequential developmental steps. Finally and focally, even though both groups' sequences were six steps long, the placement of pretence relative to other ToM milestones varied with hearing status. Deaf children understood social pretending at an earlier step in the ToM sequence than hearing children, albeit at a later chronological age. Theoretically, the findings are relevant to questions about how universal developmental progressions come together along with culturally distinctive inputs and biological factors (such as hearing loss) to set the pace for ToM development.}

  abstract = {Theory of mind (ToM) was examined in late-signing deaf children in two studies by using standard tests and measures of spontaneous talk about inner states of perception, affect and cognition during storytelling. In Study 1, there were 21 deaf children aged 6 to 11 years and 13 typical-hearing children matched with the deaf by chronological age. In Study 2, there were 17 deaf children aged 6 to 12 years and 17 typical-hearing preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years who were matched with the deaf by ToM test performance. In addition to replicating the consistently reported finding of poor performance on standard false belief tests by late-signing deaf children, significant correlations emerged in both studies between deaf children's ToM test scores and their spontaneous narrative talk about imaginative cognition (e.g. ‘pretend’). In Study 2, with a new set of purpose-built pictures that evoked richer and more complex mentalistic narration than the published picture book of Study 1, results of multiple regression analyses showed that children's narrative talk about imaginative cognition was uniquely important, over and above hearing status and talking of other kinds of mental states, in predicting ToM scores. The same was true of children's elaborated narrative talk using utterances that either spelt out thoughts, explained inner states or introduced contrastives. In addition, results of a Guttman scalogram analysis in Study 2 suggested a consistent sequence in narrative and standard test performance by deaf and hearing children that went from (1) narrative mention of visible (affective or perceptual) mental states only, along with FB failure, to (2) narrative mention of cognitive states along with (1), to (3) elaborated narrative talk about inner states along with (2), and finally to (4) simple and elaborated narrative talk about affective/perceptual and cognitive states along with FB test success. Possible explanations for this performance ordering, as well as for the observed correlations in both studies between ToM test scores and narrative variables, were considered.}

  abstract = {This study aimed to establish whether or not young children and young people with autism can understand the mental state of intention. Participants were exposed to personal experience of unintended outcomes, to test if they could distinguish intended vs. unintended actions. Recognizing accidental outcomes was more difficult for normal 4-year-olds than 5-year-olds, and more difficult for young people with autism, compared with comparison groups. Such findings suggest that the theory of mind deficit observed in people with autism is not restricted to understanding epistemic states, but also extends to understanding intention. The results are also compatible with an action-monitoring deficit. Future research needs to test these two accounts against each other., 15 April 1996, 9 October 1997}

  abstract = {This study aims to investigate representational and syntactical flexibility in children's drawing behaviour, and the extent to which changes introduced at both representational and syntactical levels are related to age or can be induced by contextual manipulations. A Deletion task required three age groups of 5-, 7- and 9-year-old children to draw objects that had been rendered partially invisible, thanks to magic transformations. Two different verbal instructions about what was to remain visible in the objects, and two different objects, one regularly and one non-regularly drawn, were designed to investigate contextual sensitivity in children's representational and syntactical behaviour respectively. The results provided evidence for sequential-like developments with regard to both representational and syntactical flexibility in children. The extent to which the procedural constraints of drawing prevented representational flexibility to be expressed was investigated in a second experiment, in which the deletions were performed by means of an eraser on pre-printed 2D line drawings. The results showed that the expression of representational flexibility across ages did not fundamentally change as a function of the load imposed by the procedural constraints.}

Events consisted of videos of a hammer striking a surface displaying a characteristic rhythm and tempo along with the synchronized impact sounds. In Expt 1, 32 infants were habituated to one rhythm presented at a constant tempo followed by test trials of a novel rhythm presented at the familiar tempo. Across subjects, four different stimulus rhythms were presented at each of four different constant tempos. Infants demonstrated significant visual recovery to a novel rhythm at all stimulus tempos. In Expt 2, 32 infants were habituated to events displaying one rhythm and tempo followed by test trials presenting a novel tempo and the familiar rhythm. Infants showed a significant visual recovery to a novel tempo, which was apparent across four different underlying rhythm contexts. More robust discrimination was observed for more extreme tempo contrasts. These data suggest that 7-month-old infants are sensitive to the invariant rhythm and tempo of bimodal events.}

Electroencephalographic (EEG) measures provide precise evidence on the temporal sequence in which relevant cognitive processes occur. Here, we offer a systematic review of EEG studies on the influence of childhood poverty on cognitive development. The paradigms used focused primarily on correlates of inhibitory control, selective attention, and unrelated task-event activity. Eighteen studies reported differences related to socioeconomic disparities, including (a) discrepancies in neural markers of interference control and early auditory sensory processing and (b) delays in the maturation of brain oscillations in frontal regions. Overall, EEG techniques appear to have predictive power over cognitive and academic performance of children. Therefore, EEG markers may be useful to evaluate the efficacy of interventions aimed to enhance cognitive development in children facing unfavorable social conditions.},

In particular, electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques allow researchers to explore high-temporal resolution of the neural activity that underlie the dynamics of cognitive processes. Although EEG research has been mostly applied in laboratory settings, recently a low-cost, portable EEG apparatus was released, which allows exploration of different emotional and cognitive processes during every-day activities. We compared a wide range of EEG measures using both a low-cost portable and a high-quality laboratory system. EEG recordings were done with both systems while participants performed an active task (Go/NoGo) and during their resting-state. Results showed similar waveforms in terms of morphology and amplitude of the ERPs, and comparable effects between conditions of the applied Go/NoGo paradigm. In addition, the contribution of each frequency to the entire EEG was not significantly different during resting- state, and fluctuations in amplitude of oscillations showed long-range temporal correlations. These results showed that low-cost, portable EEG technology can provide an alternative of enough quality for measuring brain activity outside a laboratory setting, which could contribute to the study of different populations in more ecological contexts.},

  abstract = {Objective: Cognitive Control (CC) is a central aspect of self-regulatory development, which can be modulated by individual differences, the quality of experiences in several developmental contexts (e.g., home, school, community), and cognitive interventions. In particular, associations between childhood poverty and cognitive and neural aspects of CC have also been documented in recent years. Less evidence is available regarding the brain areas influence by cognitive intervention in children from poor homes. In the present study, we examined the impact of a computerized, cognitive training that was implemented at a kindergarten on inhibitory control performance by cognitive and EEG methods. Methods: Children were trained weekly for 8 weeks and tested before and after the intervention using EEG recordings during a Go/NoGo task performance. Children in the intervention group (n = 24; 18 girls, mean age 5.32 ± 0.39 years) played games that tapped inhibitory control, working memory, and planning demands on a tablet, whereas those in the control group (n = 20; 7 girls, mean age 5.42 ± 0.27 years) played Internet free games with the same schedule. Results: Electrophysiological measures related to performance of inhibitory control showed improvements only in the intervention group, and no differences were found in cognitive performance. Specifically, only the intervention group showed in increase in the frontal N2-effect; that is, there was larger differentiation between the amplitude of N2-NoGo and N2-Go in the post-test stage. Conclusions: These results show: (a) that the implemented intervention modulated the neural resources related to inhibitory control processes, and (b) it is possible to implement portable neural methodologies in school settings to enhance the evaluation of cognitive training interventions by adding an EEG component.},

Forty seven interactions between medium-low and low socioeconomic status children  and their teachers in public educational institutions of the Province of Entre Ríos,  Argentina, were analyzed. A multivariate analysis that gathers techniques of factor  analysis and classification was carried out. The results configured three classes:  composed mostly of story-reading situations, with long turns by the teacher and  syntactic complexity in the children; composed of corner play situations, where both  the teacher and the children displayed a greater volume of speech; and constituted  mainly by round situations, with an overall lower speech volume than the other two  classes. With the exception of lexical diversity, the linguistic properties considered  contributed to explain the particular configurations of the interchanges in the story  reading, corner play and round situations.

As a measure of textism knowledge, the children were asked to compose text messages they might write if they were in each of a set of scenarios. Their text messages were coded for types of text abbreviations (textisms) used, and the ratio of textisms to total words was calculated to indicate density of textism use. The children also completed a short questionnaire about their mobile phone use. The ratio of textisms to total words used was positively associated with word reading, vocabulary, and phonological awareness measures. Moreover, the children's textism use predicted word reading ability after controlling for individual differences in age, short-term memory, vocabulary, phonological awareness and how long they had owned a mobile phone. The nature of the contribution that textism knowledge makes to children's word reading attainment is discussed in terms of the notion of increased exposure to print, and Crystal's (2006a) notion of ludic language use.}

Experiment 1 documented developmental differences in 6-, 8- and 10-year-olds' use of spatial clustering in a tour-planning and in a free recall task. Children hid objects in a dollhouse and later recalled the objects or planned a tour of the objects. Ten-year-olds, but not 6- and 8-year-olds, who planned the tour showed more spatial clustering than did their counterparts who performed the standard free recall task. Experiment 2 investigated transfer of spatial clustering strategies from the more supportive tour-planning task to the free recall task. Eight- and 10-year-olds again hid objects in the dollhouse and then performed a tour-planning or a free recall task. Immediately afterward, all children performed a free recall of the objects. Ten-year-olds, but not 8-year-olds, who performed the tour-planning task first showed significantly more spatial clustering in their subsequent free recall than did their counterparts who performed the free recall task first. Discussion focuses on factors that lead to developmental changes in children's ability to apply their spatial clustering skills to different tasks.}

  abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to argue for an ‘epigenetic developmental interpretation’ of connectionist modelling of human cognitive processes, and to propose that Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models provide a superior account of developmental phenomena than that offered by cognitivist (symbolic) computational theories. After comparing some of the general characteristics of epigeneticist and cognitivist theories, we provide a brief overview of the operating principles underlying Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their associated learning procedures. Four applications of different PDP architectures to developmental phenomena are described. First, we assess the current status of the debate between symbolic and connectionist accounts of the process of English past tense formation. Second, we introduce a connectionist model of concept formation and vocabulary growth and show how it provides an account of aspects of semantic development in early childhood. Next, we take up the problem of compositionality and structure dependency in connectionist nets, and demonstrate that PDP models can be architecturally designed to capture the structural principals characteristic of human cognition. Finally, we review a connectionist model of cognitive develop ment which yields stage-like behavioural properties even though architectural and input assumptions remain constant throughout training. It is shown how the organizational characteristics of the model provide a simple but precise account of the equilibration of the processes of accommodation and assimilation. The article concludes that a coherent epigcnctic-developmental interpretation of PDP modelling rquires the rejection of so-called hybrid-architecture theories of human cognition.}

Understanding of the role of EF in aggression has been hindered, however, by the lack of research taking into account the function and form of aggression and the almost exclusive focus on cool EF. This study examined the role of cool and hot EF in teacher reported aggression, differentiating between reactive and proactive as well as physical and relational aggression. Children (N = 106) completed laboratory tasks measuring cool (inhibition, planning, working memory) and hot EF (affective decision-making, delay of gratification). Cool, but not hot, EF significantly contributed to understanding of childhood aggression. Inhibition was a central predictor of childhood aggression. Planning and working memory, in contrast, were significant independent predictors of proactive relational aggression only. Added to this, prosocial behaviour moderated the relationship between working memory and reactive relational aggression. This study therefore suggests that cool EF, particularly inhibition, is associated with childhood aggression across the different functions and forms.},

  abstract = {Using their previously demonstrated gaze-following abilities, juvenile chimpanzees (and 3-year-old human children) were tested to determine if they interpreted seeing as the mental state of attention. The studies tested predictions generated by a low-level model of chimpanzee gaze-following which assumes that chimpanzees do not understand attention as an unobservable, internal mental state, and a high-level model which assumes that they do. In Expts 1 and 2, chimpanzees were first trained to respond to a cup to which an experimenter pointed, and then tested on probe trials to determine if they could respond correctly when the experimenter either oriented his or her whole head toward the correct cup, or just looked with the eyes. In Expt 1 these cues were static, whereas in Expt 2 the experimenter actively moved his or her head and/or eyes back-and-forth form the subjects’ faces to the correct cup as they were attempting to make their choice. Expt 3 validated the logic of Expts 1 and 2 by demonstrating that 3-year-old human children responded in a manner predicted by the high-level model. The results of the experiments converged on supporting the predictions of the low-level model of juvenile chimpanzees’ understanding of seeing.}

  abstract = {The development of gaze-following (or joint visual attention) allows human infants to orient to the same object or event to which another person is looking. The development of the ability undergoes elaborations between 6 and 18 months, with older infants displaying the ability to (a) track gaze in response to eye movement alone, (b) look into space outside of their immediate visual field, and (c) precisely localize the exact object at which another is looking. Chimpanzees also exhibit gaze-following, but certain aspects of the specificity of this ability remain unclear. Seven pre-adolescent chimpanzees were used to replicate and extend a previous demonstration of gaze-following and to test the hypothesis that chimpanzees (like 18-month-old human infants) are capable of determining the specific location in space behind them into which another looks. The results strongly support the hypothesis, and suggest extensive commonality in the behavioural manifestations of gaze-following in the two species. Whether chimpanzees develop a parallel understanding of the mental state of attention behind gaze remains less clear.}

  abstract = {While the productive role of social interaction between peers in promoting cognitive development has been clearly established, the communicative processes through which this is achieved is less clearly understood. Earlier work has established that different types of conversation become established between children as they work together on a problem, and that these types have different implications for the progress of a non-conserver. The paper focuses on the forms of recognition that emerge within these different conversation types. It reports further analyses of a study in which 226 6.5- to 7.5-year-old children were presented with a Piagetian task of conservation of liquid. Conservers and non-conservers were asked to discuss in pairs their conflicting answers and agree upon a joint response. Cognitive progress was assessed by pre- to post-test gains. Analyses of the conversational moves made by each of the participants to the conversation indicates that both non-conservers and conservers not only make characteristic contributions, but that these contributions vary across the conversation types, and hence also relate differentially to the non-conserver's progress. More detailed qualitative analyses of the different conversation types provide insights into the ways in which different forms of recognition emerge through these interactions. These results are discussed in relation to a socio-cognitive account of development.}

  abstract = {Mother and child ADHD symptoms both have a negative effect on parenting. Little is known about how these characteristics interact. In a recent paper, we reported two studies that suggested that maternal ADHD ameliorated the negative effects of child ADHD on negative parenting supporting a similarity-fit hypothesis. The aim of the current paper is to extend this analysis to a sample of mothers and fathers. The study examined the association between child and adult ADHD symptoms on child-specific parenting practices in 278 mothers and 85 fathers from a population-based sample of school-age children. As in the previous study, high levels of ADHD symptoms in mothers ameliorated the negative effects of child ADHD on parenting – supporting the similarity-fit hypothesis. Fathers demonstrated the opposite effect with high levels of ADHD exacerbating the effects of child ADHD – supporting a similarity-misfit hypothesis. The study confirms the important role played by parental ADHD symptoms in parenting while highlighting differences between mothers and fathers in this regard.}

Strengths and points of criticism deriving from existing alternative positions are illustrated. Particular emphasis is put on the neuroconstructivist framework with the aim of evaluating whether the hypotheses driven by this approach are in line with the available evidence. Within the neuroconstructivist framework, a novel model is proposed in which the direct-matching and action reconstruction viewpoints on action understanding processes can be integrated by assuming a developmental perspective. It is suggested that mirroring mechanisms are shaped by a domain-relevant narrowing process driven by sensorimotor experience and that action understanding can take advantage of both top-down and bottom-up processes, in a multilevel and dynamic fashion.},

  abstract = {Theoretical links between emotional knowledge and theory of mind (ToM) have previously been proposed. This study investigates this relationship using measures of both ability and trait emotional intelligence (EI). Our sample comprised 194 children, divided into two age groups (5–7 years and 8–10 years). Children participated in measures of false belief understanding, advanced tests of ToM, ability EI and trait EI, and a standardized language assessment. For both age groups, we found that only ability EI was related to false belief understanding. Furthermore, regression analyses revealed that the understanding and managing branches of ability EI predicted unique variance in false belief understanding once controlling for age, language, and the other ability EI branches. Trait EI failed to display any association with false belief understanding. Ability and trait EI were associated with more advanced ToM tasks undertaken only by the older sample. These results offer support for previous research that has found a relationship between emotion perception and labelling and ToM. They also provide new knowledge: (1) higher order emotional knowledge, measured by ability EI, is associated with advanced ToM; and (2) emotional self efficacy, as measured by trait EI, is also important in advanced ToM. Furthermore, they provide the first account of associations between standardized EI measures and ToM.}

  abstract = {In this report, we introduce Qwen2.5, a comprehensive series of large language models (LLMs) designed to meet diverse needs. Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning. Post-training techniques enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich sizes. Open-weight offerings include base and instruction-tuned models, with quantized versions available. In addition, for hosted solutions, the proprietary models currently include two mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants: Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus, both available from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Qwen2.5 has demonstrated top-tier performance on a wide range of benchmarks evaluating language understanding, reasoning, mathematics, coding, human preference alignment, etc. Specifically, the open-weight flagship Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct outperforms a number of open and proprietary models and demonstrates competitive performance to the state-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5 times larger. Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus offer superior cost-effectiveness while performing competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively. Additionally, as the foundation, Qwen2.5 models have been instrumental in training specialized models such as Qwen2.5-Math, Qwen2.5-Coder, QwQ, and multimodal models.},

  abstract = {The central question debated in current research on infant social cognition is ‘do infants have a theory of mind?’ It is argued here that this question is understood and treated in radically different ways by different participants of the debate arguing either for (e.g., Onishi \& Baillargeon, 2005) or against early competence in theory of mind (e.g., Perner \& Ruffman, 2005). As a consequence, there is considerable talking past each other, both sides make claims that appear incompatible but are actually answers to different questions and framed at different levels of description. Some conceptual distinctions from the philosophy of mind are therefore introduced to describe the different interpretations of the question and the misunderstandings based thereupon, with the aim of providing some conceptual clarification as groundwork for future debates.}

  abstract = {We investigated young children's awareness of the context-relative rule structure of simple games. Two contexts were established in the form of spatial locations. Familiar objects were used in their conventional way at location 1, but acquired specific functions in a rule game at location 2. A third party then performed the conventional act at either of the two locations, constituting a mistake at location 2 (experimental condition), but appropriate at location 1 (control condition). Three-year-olds (but not 2-year-olds) systematically distinguished the two conditions, spontaneously intervening with normative protest against the third party act in the experimental, but not in the control condition. Young children thus understand context-specific rules even when the context marking is non-linguistic. These results are discussed in the broader context of the development of social cognition and cultural learning.}

School classrooms are highly cluttered audiovisual scenes containing many overlapping faces and voices. Due to the difficulty of labeling them (reliable coding requires weeks of training) and their sensitive nature (students and teachers may be in stressful or potentially embarrassing situations), CLASS- labeled classroom video datasets are scarce, and their labels are sparse (just a few labels per 15-minute video dip). Thus, the overarching challenge was how to harness modern deep perceptual architectures despite the paucity of labeled data. Through training low-level CNN-based facial attribute detectors (facial expression \& adult/child) as well as a direct audio-to- climate regressor, and by integrating low-level information over time using a Bi-LSTM, we constructed automated detectors of positive and negative classroom climate with accuracy (10- fold cross-validation Pearson correlation on 241 CLASS-labeled videos) of 0.40 and 0.51, respectively. These numbers are superior to what we obtained using shallower architectures. This work represents the first automated system designed to detect specific dimensions of the CLASS.},

  abstract = {The present study dealt with an aspect of temporal cognition that is rarely discussed in the literature: the ability to estimate the duration of familiar actions. In everyday life, we often have to process both very short durations (e.g., when we are driving), but we also have to deal with actions or events that last for several minutes or even hours (e.g., watching a film). The aim of our study was to examine whether young children aged six and 9 years and adults are able to estimate the time usually taken by various familiar actions to perform using a production task. More precisely, they were successively presented with photographs of familiar actions that usually take more (e.g., blown a balloon up) or less (e.g., blow a candle out) time to perform. As soon as a photograph was presented on the screen, they have to start estimating the time taken to perform the depicted action and press the space bar when they think that this time has elapsed. Results showed that the 6-year-olds failed to produce longer durations for the long action category than for the short one, unlike the older children and adults. Moreover, for the short action category, increasingly short durations were produced with age. Only the adults produced different durations for different actions belonging to the same category (i.e., short or long). These results are discussed in relation to the development of an event-based system of time that can be used to solve duration tasks. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Young children understand the relative durations of daily actions. There is not any mapping between duration words and approximate durations in young children. Young children have great difficulty in understanding that the same duration can be shared by different actions. What the present study adds? There is a clear improvement with age in the ability to produce the durations of familiar actions. Children can use the event-based system of time they develop to successfully perform duration tasks.},

However, assessment of empathy in children is constrained by a lack of suitable measurement instruments. This article outlines the development of the Kids' Empathic Development Scale (KEDS) designed to assess some of the core affective, cognitive and behavioural components of empathy concurrently. The KEDS assesses responses to picture scenarios depicting a range of individual and interpersonal situations differing in social complexity. Results from 220 children indicate the KEDS measures three related but distinct aspects of empathy that are also related to existing measures of empathy and cognitive development. Scores on the KEDS show age and some gender-related differences in the expected direction.}

In this regard, the “panglial synctium” formed by electrically and chemically coupled stellate astrocytes (“general mammalian” architecture) is believed to provide an intracellular pathway for the redistribution of ions and molecules within the cerebral cortex. Long astroglial interlaminar processes (“primate-specific” architecture) that run parallel to apical dendrites in the cerebral cortex of primates, may provide additional properties to the glial participation in cortical physiology and function. Since these processes are exclusively present within the primate order, functional models of cortical computations for these species should incorporate the astroglial interlaminar architecture in addition to the panglial synctium. This study analyzes possible implications of interlaminar astroglial processes, for the regulation of the extracellular ionic composition and segregation of functional columns in the cerebral cortex.},

  abstract = {This study addresses two questions: is there a development in children's ability to focus on and reproduce the visual projections of simple three-dimensional scenes? If so, what factors determine this development? Children aged 5 to 9 viewed displays of objects with simple shapes (ball, box) through a peephole in a screen. They were required to cover the visual projections of the objects by sticking cut-out forms onto a transparency that could be fixed against a vertical glass pane (a da Vinci window) placed between the child and the scene. The forms had to match exactly the projective shape, size and position of the projections at the glass pane, from the given viewpoint. To achieve success, participants had to analyse and mentally record the properties of the projections to choose the correct forms from a set of alternatives, and to place them correctly on the transparency. Three different scenes were presented. For each scene, participants were allowed as many trials as they wished. Results showed differences in performance according to age and scene. Only a few 5- and 6-year-olds succeeded in the tasks; in 9-year-olds, the success rate varied from 50 to 100 per cent. Performance was better for the projections of balls placed at different distances than for the projection of the side of a box placed at an angle to the fronto-parallel plane. The sequences of trials made by participants, and the success rates for different aspects of the projections (shape, size and position) suggested that two cognitive factors explain children's difficulties in the task: (i) difficulty in differentiating the real and the projective properties of the objects in the scenes; (ii) lack of spatial skills needed to accurately analyse and reproduce the geometry of the projections}

  abstract = {This study investigated 15- and 18-month-olds' understanding of the link between actions and emotions. Infants watched a videotape in which three adult models performed an action on an object. Each adult expressed the same emotion (positive, negative, or neutral affect) on completion of the action. Infants were subsequently given 20 seconds to interact with the object. Infants were less likely to perform the target action after the models' expressed negative as opposed to positive or neutral affect. Although infants' imitative behaviour was influenced by the models' emotional displays, this social referencing effect was not apparent in their more general object-directed behaviour. For instance, infants in the negative emotion condition were just as quick to touch the object and spent the same amount of time touching the object as did infants in the neutral and positive emotion conditions. These findings suggest that infants understood that the models' negative affect was in response to the action, rather than the object itself. Infants apparently used this negative emotional information to appraise the action as one that was ‘undesirable’ or ‘bad’. Consequently, infants were now loath to reproduce the action themselves.}

Ninety-six children (24 in four groups aged 8, 9, 10, and 11 years) and 24 adults performed an episodic memory (EM) task involving old/new, remember/know (R/K), and source memory judgements and numerous WM tasks that assessed verbal and spatial components of WM and delayed short-term memory (STM). Developmental changes were observed in EM with younger children (8-, 9-, 10-year-olds) making fewer remember responses than 11-year-olds and adults while 11-year-olds did not differ from adults. Only children aged 10 years plus showed a relationship between EM and WM. EM was related to verbal executive WM in 10- and 11-year-old children suggesting that children at this stage use verbal strategies to aid EM. In contrast, EM was related to spatial executive WM in adults. The engagement of episodic retrieval processes appears to be selectively related to executive components of verbal and spatial WM, the pattern of which differs in children and adults.}

They also participated in a chemistry teaching session, practical, and assessment on the topic of acids and alkalis designed specifically for this study. Executive function data were related to (1) the chemistry assessment which included aspects of factual and conceptual learning and (2) a recent school science exam. Correlational analyses between executive functions and both the chemistry assessment and science grades revealed that science achievements were significantly correlated with working memory. Linear regression analysis revealed that visuospatial working memory ability was predictive of chemistry performance. Interestingly, this relationship was observed solely in relation to the conceptual learning condition of the assessment highlighting the role of executive functions in understanding and applying knowledge about what is learned within science teaching.},

  abstract = {Recent research has suggested that particular content of television programmes, such as watching fantastical scenes, can have negative consequences on cognitive functions in young children. We examined the effects of watching fantastical programmes on executive functions measured at both pre- and post-television viewing. Eighty 5- to 6-year-old children participated and were randomized into either fantastical or non-fantastical conditions. They completed inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and planning tasks both before and after watching either the brief fantastical or non-fantastical television clip. Whilst there were no differences between the groups at pre-test on any of the cognitive measures, children in the fantastical condition were poorer on inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility tasks at the post-test session. Watching fantastical television content, even briefly, seems to disrupt cognitive function performance in young children across a broad range of aspects of executive function. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Exposure to fantastical content within a television programme may impair executive functions in young children. What does this study add? Exposure to fantastical content within television programmes impairs executive functions in children of early primary school age. Impairment extends to all three core aspects of executive functions. Watching fantastical clips slows down planning performance without improving accuracy.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates mobile phone use as a medium of inter-generational communication. Research on teenage mobile phone use has tended to focus on its peer group functionality. In this paper, the mobile phone is examined as a transitional object in parent–teen interrelationships. Specifically, drawing on ethnographic work conducted in Israel among teenagers between 2000 and 2006, the paper focuses on mobile telephones as physical objects that can connect people and mediate relationships. It is shown that, for parents and their teenage children, the mobile phone is important more for the possibility of communication and less for the text or voice conversation it actually carries. Analysis focuses also on the role of the mobile phone in enabling inter-generational distance and intimacy, attending to the complicated ways in which the mobile phone is employed by parents and their teenage children. It is argued that the analysis of mobile phone practices needs to take directly into account the specific cultural contexts of production and consumption, as culture, technology and family mutually shape one another.}

  abstract = {In this study, deaf children's understanding of their own emotions was compared with that of hearing peers. Twenty-six deaf children (mean age 11 years) and 26 hearing children, matched for age and gender, were presented with various tasks that tap into their emotion awareness and regulation (coping) regarding the four basic emotions (happiness, anger, sadness, and fear). The findings suggest that deaf children have no difficulties in identifying their own basic emotions and the elicitors, or multiple emotions of opposite valence (happy and sad). Yet, they did show an impaired capacity to differentiate between their own emotions within the negative spectrum, which suggests a more generic evaluation of the situation. Deaf children's emotion regulation strategies showed a strong preference for approaching the situation at hand, but almost no deaf child reported the use of an avoidant tactic in order to diminish the negative impact of the situation. Overall, deaf children's emotion regulation strategies seemed less effective than those of their hearing peers. The implications for deaf children's emotional development are discussed.}

Therefore, we examined the extent to which emotion awareness (e.g., recognizing and appreciating one's own and the emotions of others) and a tendency for certain social roles (e.g., helping or teasing peers when being bullied) are related to adolescents’ levels of empathy. The sample was comprised of 182 adolescents aged between 11 and 16. Empathy and emotion awareness were assessed using self-report measures. Peer reports were used to indicate adolescents’ different social roles: Bullying, defending the victim, and outsider behaviour. Outcomes demonstrated that evaluating one's own and the emotions of others, and more defending nominations were associated with both affective and cognitive empathy, whereas aspects of emotion awareness which are linked with internalizing symptoms were related to empathic distress, suggesting maladaptive emotion appraisal. Furthermore, outsider behaviour was associated with empathic distress, emphasizing a self-focused orientation. In contrast, more bullying was negatively associated with cognitive empathy. Overall, these outcomes demonstrate that, besides social roles, emotion awareness is an important factor for adaptive empathic reactions, whereas emotion dysregulation might cause distress when witnessing the negative feelings of others.},

  abstract = {In this study, the authors examined the extent to which children’s self-regulation upon kindergarten entrance and classroom quality in kindergarten contributed to children’s adaptive classroom behavior. Children’s self-regulation was assessed using a direct assessment upon entrance into kindergarten. Classroom quality was measured on the basis of multiple classroom observations during the kindergarten year. Children’s adaptive classroom behavior in kindergarten was assessed through teacher report and classroom observations: Teachers rated children’s cognitive and behavioral self-control and work habits during the spring of the kindergarten year; observers rated children’s engagement and measured off-task behavior at 2-month intervals from November to May. Hierarchical linear models revealed that children’s self-regulation upon school entry in a direct assessment related to teachers’ report of behavioral self-control, cognitive self-control, and work habits in the spring of the kindergarten year. Classroom quality, particularly teachers’ effective classroom management, was linked to children’s greater behavioral and cognitive self-control, children’s higher behavioral engagement, and less time spent off-task in the classroom. Classroom quality did not moderate the relation between children’s self-regulation upon school entry and children’s adaptive classroom behaviors in kindergarten. The discussion considers the implications of classroom management for supporting children’s early development of behavioral skills that are important in school settings.},

  abstract = {Despite the presumed relationship between analogical reasoning and intelligence, few studies have addressed this relationship empirically. Notably, no comparative studies have been conducted to compare the performance of severely learning disabled (SLD) and normal children, partly due to an implicit assumption that SLD children are incapable of analogical reasoning. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that SLD children would be capable of analogical reasoning to a level commensurate with normal children matched for developmental age, if tested with familiar concepts and an appropriate task. Eighty children in three groups (SLD, 3–4- and 5–6-year-olds) were presented with 16 verbal analogies in the context of a multiple choice card game called ‘Pairs’. Analogies were varied for familiarity of concepts used and inclusion of a high associate response alternative. Results showed that the SLD group could engage in analogical reasoning but their performance was significantly below that of 5–6-year-olds. It was concluded that this difference was due firstly to the use of an inappropriate measure of familiarity and secondly to differences in the way groups approached the task.}

  abstract = {Children with congenital blindness are delayed in understanding other people's minds. The present study examined whether this delay was related to a more primitive form of inter-subjectivity by which infants draw correspondence between parental mirroring of the infant's display and proprioceptive sensations. Twenty children with congenital blindness and 20 typically-developing sighted children aged between 4 and 12 years were administered a series of tasks examining false belief and emotion understanding and production. The blind children scored lower on the false belief tasks and did not convey emotions facially to adult observers as accurately as sighted participants. The adults' ratings of the children's expressions were correlated with the children's scores on the false belief tasks. It is suggested that understanding people's minds might be anchored in primitive embodied forms of relatedness.}

Cross-cultural differences explained 28\% of the variance in arithmetic and 17.3\% of the variance in mathematical reasoning, with Chinese children outperforming the other two groups. No cross-cultural differences were observed for spatial ability and mathematical anxiety. In all samples, symbolic magnitude processing and mathematical reasoning were independently related to early arithmetic. Other factors, such as non-symbolic magnitude processing, mental rotation, intelligence, and mathematical anxiety, produced differential patterns across the populations. The results are discussed in relation to potential influences of parental practice, school readiness, and linguistic factors on individual differences in early mathematics. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Cross-cultural differences in mathematical ability are present in preschool children. Similar mechanisms of mathematical development operate in preschool children from the United Kingdom, Russia, and China. Tasks that require understanding of numbers are best predictors of arithmetic in preschool children. What does this study add? Cross-cultural differences in mathematical ability become greater with age/years of formal education. Similar mechanisms of mathematical development operate in early primary school children from the United Kingdom, Russia, and China. Symbolic number magnitude and mathematical reasoning are the main predictors of arithmetic in all three populations.},

This involved examination of the working memory processes of the phonological loop and central executive (Baddeley, 1986) as a potential means of differentiating ADHD from RD. The participants were 16 ADHD/RD, 16 RD and 16 normal control children, matched for sex, age and IQ, who performed tasks tapping phonological loop function, a combination of phonological loop and central executive functioning, and tasks relying on central executive functioning. Analysis revealed that as the involvement of the central executive in tasks increased, ADHD/RD children performed worse than the other groups. This was on measures of controlled information processing, modifying and accommodating new input and supervisory capacity. These findings reflect the potential utility of the central executive in working memory in understanding the nature of executive processing deficits in ADHD. They also support the efficacy of these tasks in discriminating ADHD from RD.}

  abstract = {Tests of strategic deception are normally assumed to measure children's understanding of mental representation and to demonstrate 3-year-olds' lack of such understanding. However they also make significant executive demands, namely: (a) provisional disengagement from a target object whilst (b) indicating a place where the target is absent. If these executive requirements constitute the core difficulty with strategic deception, young children should continue to fail such tests when there is no opponent to deceive but when the executive requirements are unchanged. Experiment 1 showed that removing the opponent did not affect the behaviour of 3-year-old subjects: they typically referred to the object location on the first test trial and often continued to do so throughout the subsequent 20 trials. Experiment 2 showed that the younger children's difficulty was caused by knowledge of the target's location not by sight of it. We discuss these data in terms of the possibility that there may be an executive contribution to the age 3–4 year transition in mental knowledge; but also caution that the role of executive factors in strategic deception should ideally be assessed by mechanical procedures.}

  abstract = {We gave 3- and 4-year-old children and autistic subjects (plus a group of Down's syndrome children of equivalent ability) a task which measured their capacity for strategic deception. This was a competitive game played between the subject and an experimenter in which the participants tried to win chocolates. In the training phase the subjects learned that it was in their interest to tell the experimenter, by pointing, to look into an empty box for the chocolate, although subjects did not know until after the search which box was empty. In the testing phase, the boxes had windows facing the child so he or she could now see which was the empty box. The 4-year-olds and the Down's children, but not the 3-year-olds and the autistic subjects, generally pointed to the empty box on the first trial. Moreover, the younger children and the autistic subjects frequently continued to point to the baited box for the full 20 test trials. We also found that the ability to apply the correct strategy on the ‘windows task’ was associated with success on a standard ‘false belief’ task and argue from this that both tasks may be difficult because they require subjects to inhibit the tendency of salient knowledge about object locations to overwrite knowledge of epistemic states.}

When the stimulus words rhymed with the colour names but were orthographically dissimilar, effects were observed only for the 8-year-olds. The pattern of results suggests that phonological and orthographic characteristics of a word are available rapidly enough, in visual word recognition, to affect colour naming. For older subjects, the pattern of effects is consistent with lexical priming. For the younger subjects, the effects are attributed to the continued influence of grapheme-phoneme translation rules in establishing production codes for word naming.}

Predicting a person's gaze target requires reasoning both about the person's appearance and the contents of the scene. Prior works have developed increasingly complex, hand-crafted pipelines for gaze target estimation that carefully fuse features from separate scene encoders, head encoders, and auxiliary models for signals like depth and pose. Motivated by the success of general-purpose feature extractors on a variety of visual tasks, we propose Gaze-LLE, a novel transformer framework that streamlines gaze target estimation by leveraging features from a frozen DINOv2 encoder. We extract a single feature representation for the scene, and apply a person-specific positional prompt to decode gaze with a lightweight module. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across several gaze benchmarks and provide extensive analysis to validate our design choices.

  abstract = {Recently, the ‘windows task’ was devised to explore preschoolers' capacity for strategic deception (Russell, Mauthner, Sharpe \& Tidswell, 1991). The windows task required a child to point at an empty box to obtain a second box which contained a desired object (a chocolate). Russell et al. (1991) found that, unlike older children, 3-year-olds consistently failed to adopt a strategy which would help them win the chocolates. A majority of their 3-year-old subjects perseverated on the wrong response across all trials of their experiment. Two experiments were devised to investigate why 3-year-olds consistently failed the windows task. Experiment 1 included five versions of this task, four of which modified Russell et al.'s instructions to see whether simplified task demands would affect the children's responses, and the fifth attempted to replicate the original wording of Russell et al. (1991). Children in all groups performed well, failing to replicate the perseveration witnessed in that experiment. Performance on the task was found to be unrelated to performance on standard theory of mind tasks. Experiment 2 was devised to replicate exactly the conditions of the Russell et al. (1991) experiment. Again, children had little difficulty solving the task. The present experiments provide evidence that children as young as 3 years can override their desire to reach or point to an object if they need to make a contrary response to obtain the object. These results indicate that executive control limitations as measured by this task cannot sufficiently explain preschoolers' failure on theory of mind tasks.}

The reward conditions varied the children's attention to rewards (salience) and length of expected reward delay to test predictions derived from the delay of gratification hypothesis. The results disconfirmed the prediction of greater decrements in intrinsic interest with increases in length of expected reward delay and, in fact, showed the opposite trend. The pattern of significant effects supported the role of reward salience. Cognitive script theory is discussed as an explanation of these results and elaborated to incorporate developmental changes in cognitive processes. The combination of attribution theory and the elaborated version of cognitive scripts is proposed to account for the undermining effect in young children and adults.}

  abstract = {La presente ponencia tiene por objeto exponer la experiencia interinstitucional de la puesta en marcha del Proyecto de Investigación “Construcción multidisciplinaria de propuestas de enseñanza para optimizar competencias cognitivas y la adquisición de aprendizajes escolares tempranos (Matemática y Lengua) en niños y niñas de 4 y 5 años en riesgo social”. Este proyecto involucra a un grupo compuesto por formadores de docentes e investigadores de las áreas de Educación Inicial (Instituto Superior de Profesorado Sara C. de Eccleston) y Neurociencia Cognitiva [Unidad de Neurobiología Aplicada (UNA-CEMIC) - Universidad Nacional de San Martín (UNSAM)]. Las experiencias de intervención realizadas por el equipo de investigadores de la Unidad de Neurobiología Aplicada, en diferentes distritos escolares del país durante los últimos diez años (Colombo y Lipina, 2005; Segretin et al., 2007), permitieron encontrar diferentes grados de mejora en el desempeño cognitivo de niños y niñas de 4 y 5 años de edad, que se encontraban en contextos de escolaridad formal y no formal, provenientes en su mayoría de contextos sociales vulnerables. Ello fue posible a partir de la implementación de diferentes propuestas individuales y grupales orientadas a estimular procesos cognitivos básicos (por ejemplo: atención, control inhibitorio, memoria de trabajo, flexibilidad). En forma específica, se ensayaron diferentes esquemas (16, 25 y 32 sesiones de trabajo durante uno o dos ciclos lectivos), diseñados como estudios longitudinales con evaluación de tales competencias, antes y después de las intervenciones. Las bases conceptuales de estas propuestas toman en cuenta el fenómeno de la plasticidad cerebral, es decir, la capacidad de organización y reorganización de circuitos corticales, así como la emergencia progresiva y sinérgica de diferentes competencias cognitivas básicas, que contribuyen a la adquisición de aprendizajes en las áreas de lengua y matemática durante los primeros años de escolaridad (Blair, 2002). Los estudios efectuados con el fin de evaluar distintos aspectos del desarrollo cognitivo en el campo de la Neurociencia Cognitiva suelen realizarse en contextos de laboratorio. Abordajes como los implementados en los estudios de la UNA, mencionados en el párrafo anterior, efectúan intervenciones en el contexto escolar, aunque no incorporan, en sus diseños, las consideraciones conceptuales y metodológicas respecto de los procesos de aprendizaje y enseñanza tales como son considerados en el área de Educación (Varma et al., 2008). El grupo de investigación se propuso avanzar en las modalidades de intervención a través del trabajo conjunto con especialistas en educación infantil, con el objetivo de contribuir a la integración de las perspectivas de intervención neurocognitivas y educativas en términos conceptuales y metodológicos. El ISPEI “Sara C. de Eccleston” ha sido, desde su creación, un espacio privilegiado de problematización y generación de propuestas innovadoras en torno a las prácticas de enseñanza para los espacios formales de atención y educación del niño menor de 6 años (Ferradás y Rome, 2007; González y Weinstein, 2006; Ruiz y Moreau, 2000; Sarlé, 2001, 2006). La posibilidad de participar en un proyecto que permite compartir experiencias, reflexiones, perspectivas, conceptualizaciones y prácticas actuales tanto en Educación, como en Neurociencia Cognitiva, resulta de interés para reflexionar acerca de dichas prácticas así como sobre los demás contenidos de la Formación Docente. En este sentido, la inclusión de aspectos referidos al desarrollo de competencias cognitivas en vinculación con la adquisición de aprendizajes escolares tempranos (específicamente para las áreas de Matemática y Lengua) es una vacancia que requiere ser considerada cuando el objetivo procura innovar en las propuestas (estrategias) de enseñanza. El desafío que significa la construcción de una mirada compleja, multidisciplinaria, implica, en primer término, la revisión de las diferencias epistemológicas, conceptuales, metodológicas y de intervención (operativas) en el aula, sostenidas por las propuestas y agendas de investigación de ambas disciplinas sostienen. Por otra parte, esto también supone la necesidad de analizar y discutir la pertinencia de tales integraciones disciplinarias teniendo en cuenta su valor ecológico para el maestro, es decir, para su capacitación y el desarrollo de tareas en el aula. La conformación y organización de un grupo interdisciplinario generó dos tipos de desafíos diferentes. En primer lugar, el referido a las perspectivas conceptuales que plantean la Didáctica y la Neurociencia Cognitiva. En segundo lugar, el vinculado con las cuestiones metodológicas en términos de lógica de investigación. En relación con el primero, el proyecto implica un diálogo a partir de paradigmas y concepciones diferentes sobre las características del aprendizaje de los niños pequeños y los tipos de intervención que facilitan la enseñanza en la escuela. Específicamente, el co-diseño, ejecución y evaluación de propuestas de enseñanza basadas en desarrollos conceptuales y prácticas actuales que proponen las disciplinas Educación y Neurociencia Cognitiva, así como sus implicancias en la capacitación a docentes, requiere la posibilidad de construir puentes entre ambas perspectivas. Estas articulaciones refieren a tres aspectos: (a) las diferentes lógicas de construcción del conocimiento y su evaluación, (b) la existencia de fenómenos correspondientes a diferentes niveles de complejidad o análisis, (c) la validez ecológica de las metodologías surgidas en el contexto de la Neurociencia Cognitiva en términos de sus contribuciones a la práctica educativa en contexto y en grupo. A modo de ejemplo, con respecto a este último aspecto, algunos de los procesos cognitivos básicos que están asociados a actividades orientadas al logro de fines requieren demandas que generen novedad y dificultad creciente en las tareas. Todos estos aspectos plantean la necesidad de reconsiderar cuestiones acerca de cómo articularlos con diferentes contenidos curriculares, cómo incluirlos en la planificación de actividades por parte de los docentes y su evaluación cuando se trabaja en el aula en general y en actividades grupales en particular. Atender estos aspectos sin perder de vista los modos de enseñanza propios del Nivel Inicial, los tiempos de los niños, el juego y la organización de la sala obliga a pensar estrategias diversas que no resulten artificiales a la hora de su puesta en acto. En cuanto al segundo desafío, el proyecto de investigación se planteó como un diseño combinado en el que resulta necesario consensuar los aspectos metodológicos propios de los diseños verificativos con los abordajes de corte generativo para el análisis de los modos de intervención docente (Goetz y LeCompte, 1988; Sirvent, 2005). En este sentido, la utilización de instrumentos para obtener información sobre los niveles iniciales y finales de desempeño de los niños en diferentes competencias neurocognitivas, así como también durante el desarrollo de las actividades en el aula, implicó entrar en diálogo con la lógica cualitativa que requiere sostener una secuencia temporal que alterne la intervención didáctica con el análisis y rediseño de la propuesta. Esto supuso generar un dispositivo orientador que permitiera complejizar la propuesta de acuerdo con la respuesta obtenida del grupo de niños y sus docentes. En otros términos, se debió consensuar la construcción de un instrumento de intervención a partir del diseño de actividades, que conjugara los procesos cognitivos básicos y los contenidos de las disciplinas específicas (Matemática y Lengua) (Ferradás y Romeo, 2007; González y Weinstein, 2006). En el diseño del instrumento de intervención, se reflejaron claramente los desafíos que debió enfrentar el equipo y que posibilitaron la discusión acerca de las cuestiones conceptuales, metodológicas y prácticas. En términos operativos, el equipo de trabajo, luego de una etapa de lecturas y discusiones compartidas, se organizó en dos grupos, cada uno de los cuales diseñó una primera versión de dos módulos de dieciséis actividades de Lengua y Matemática para niños de 5 años, con contenidos acordes a las sugerencias del currículo vigente. A partir de ellas, se comenzó el rediseño en función a la demanda de procesos cognitivos básicos. Luego de una primera prueba piloto en dos salas de 5 años, se incluyeron ajustes en el instrumento en función de las observaciones y entrevistas realizadas con las maestras participantes. Estos ajustes llevaron a modificar la primera versión y enriquecerla con una descripción más detallada de cómo cada aspecto de la actividad demanda procesos cognitivos básicos y qué tipo de mediación docente se requiere para asegurar la puesta en marcha de dichos procesos. En esta secuencia, resulta interesante el equilibrio que se necesita alcanzar en cuanto al diseño del instrumento. Desde una perspectiva metodológica verificacionista, se requiere tener la mayor cantidad de las variables probadas en cuanto a definición de la actividad, modos de intervención del maestro, organización grupal, tiempos de los niños, etc. Desde la perspectiva generativa, las actividades no pueden presentarse tan estructuradas para el maestro, que le impidan la realización de las mismas. Los educadores conciben la planificación como una anticipación o un bosquejo de la tarea más que como un instructivo a seguir. La mirada metodológica de este proceso abre una serie de preguntas tales como la validez del instrumento diseñado para estudios en contextos escolares, la utilización de instructivos, la profundidad de las observaciones y la definición de protocolos previos. Tradiciones, modos de operar y visiones sobre la educación entran en juego a la hora de definir la entrada en instituciones con niños y docentes que participan de una propuesta, ya sea por el interés de aprender o por la solicitud de colaborar en la construcción de nuevas prácticas de enseñanza A modo de cierre, las tareas efectuadas hasta el presente resultan alentadoras en la búsqueda de puntos de encuentro en este esfuerzo interdisciplinario entre la Educación y la Neurociencia Cognitiva. Del trabajo conjunto, surgen una serie de interrogantes generales directamente vinculados con las preocupaciones que dieron origen al equipo. En primer lugar, nos preguntamos en qué medida la comprensión de los procesos cognitivos básicos que subyacen al funcionamiento mental puede mejorar la enseñanza. En tal sentido, surge la necesidad de analizar cuáles serían los conocimientos que se requieren incorporar en el currículo de la formación (profundidad, enfoque, pertinencia de los mismos, etc.). En segundo lugar, evaluar en qué medida considerar los procesos cognitivos básicos en la enseñanza no los conforma en contenidos de enseñanza. Es decir, cómo integrar estos aspectos en un diseño curricular organizado por campos de conocimiento; cómo se definirían estos contenidos y cuáles serían los criterios de evaluación, etc. En tercer lugar, nos preguntamos sobre el tipo de mediación que los maestros deberían considerar al realizar las propuestas de enseñanza. En este sentido, uno de los aspectos más significativos observados en la prueba piloto del instrumento de intervención fue la mejora de la intervención docente cuando se le daban indicaciones precisas en torno a las preguntas, tiempos de espera o modos de presentar la propuesta. Aún cuando la actividad era muy cercana a sus tareas habituales, el maestro prestaba especial atención a ciertos aspectos que aparecían como naturalizados en otras situaciones observadas. La posibilidad de generar una agenda de discusión y diseño de propuestas pertinentes para contextos culturales locales y ajustados a los requerimientos curriculares vigentes (GCBA, 2000), permite mirar a los IFD como espacios de innovación y producción de conocimiento para las prácticas de enseñanza y puede ser un punto de partida interesante a la hora de pensar la Formación Docente en general y para el Nivel Inicial en particular.},

Previous research exploring the importance of genetic contributions to individual differences in motor activity across age have been clouded by subjective errors that may arise when assessments of AL rely on human judgement. The present study is a longitudinal extension of an initial study demonstrating genetic influences on mechanically assessed AL in 7-month-old twins (Saudino \& Eaton, 1991). The motor activity of 35-month-old twins (37 MZ pairs, 16 DZ pairs) was re-evaluated with motion recorders and parent ratings over a two-day period. Despite a lack of phenotypic stability, mechanically assessed AL continued to show a genetic influence during early childhood (RMZ = .76, RDZ = .51). Moreover, the MZ-DZ pattern for concordance on AL change (RMZ = .75 vs. RDZ = .52) was consistent with the presence of a genetic influence on developmental change.}

Cross-age correlations for the three IBR factors (Activity, Task Orientation and Affect-Extraversion) were moderately low, suggesting that temperament in the second year of life is marked by change rather than continuity. At each age there was significant genetic influence on each temperament dimension. Moreover, the magnitude of heritability was similar across age, suggesting that heritability does not change dramatically from 14 to 24 months of age. The results of model-fitting analyses of continuity and change were similar for each IBR factor: no new genetic effects emerged at 20 or 24 months; shared environmental influences were non-significant at all ages; and there were substantial non-shared environmental influences unique to each age. Thus, change, which predominates over continuity in tester-rated temperament during the second year of life, can be attributed to environmental factors. Continuity appears to be due to genetic factors.}

  abstract = {In a longitudinal study the contribution of mothers' attachment concerns to the infant negative emotionality was examined. Ninety-three mothers described their child's temperament at 3 and 9 months. The results revealed that increased negative emotionality at 9 months was related not only to high levels of fussiness at 3 months but also to mothers' concerns and worries about their personal relationships. It was found that infants of mothers who tended to be avoidant in their close adult relationships showed increased levels of negative emotionality during the latter part of the first year. Further, infants of mothers who appeared secure (not avoidant) in their adult close relationships showed decreased levels of negative emotionality. The findings of the present study give some support to a directional link between caregivers' characteristics and the regulation of negative emotionality in infancy.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            The concepts of executive function (EF) and effortful control (EC) are strikingly similar. EF originate from neurocognitive research and are described as an accumulation of cognitive processes that serve the goal‐oriented self‐regulation (SR) of an individual. EC originates from temperament research and is defined as the efficiency of executive attention, including the ability to inhibit a dominant response, to activate a subdominant response, to proceed in a planned manner and to recognize conflicts or errors. The aim of this article was to examine the association between the constructs of EF and EC at the preschool‐age. Eighty‐eight children (49 female;               M               ‐age~=~3.93 years,               SD               ~=~.78) were tested with a computerized battery designed to assess EF at 3–6 years of age (EF Touch). Children's parents completed questionnaires assessing EF impairments (BRIEF‐P) and EC (CBQ). Associations between the constructs and their conceptual overlap were analyzed using correlations and confirmatory factor analyses. We found significant correlations between EF and EC measures. A one‐factor confirmatory model fitted the data very well and indicated that EF and EC are indeed overlapping and highly similar constructs. Therefore, our results show that measures of EC and EF have substantial overlap in preschoolers and suggest an integrated model of self‐regulation.},

  abstract = {Three groups of infants, differing in their age and walking experience, were presented with optical flow in a moving hallway, and postural adjustments were measured. Children either stood still, or walked back and forth within this hallway in two conditions. In the first, the hallway was uncluttered; in the second, a guidance task was created by placing obstacles (rubber traffic pylons) along the path. For standing trials, there were no significant differences in postural responses between the two conditions. For walking trials, children staggered and fell more often in the presence of obstacles. It appears that steering through a cluttered environment increases postural perturbation during imposed optical flow. These results suggest that two discrete functions, maintaining postural stability and steering, are involved in locomotion, and are guided by different informational aspects of optical flow. Increasing age and walking experience allows children to learn to distinguish between these two types of information, providing them with a means for better integrating these two concurrent functions.}

  abstract = {Despite significant recent advances in the field of face recognition, implementing face verification and recognition efficiently at scale presents serious challenges to current approaches. In this paper we present a system, called FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings as feature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128-bytes per face. On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63\%. On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12\%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result by 30\% on both datasets. We also introduce the concept of harmonic embeddings, and a harmonic triplet loss, which describe different versions of face embeddings (produced by different networks) that are compatible to each other and allow for direct comparison between each other.},

The participants were 24 8- and 9-year-old children scoring poorly relative to peers, on a classroom observation scale and teacher rating scale for attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity [low-attentional skills (LAS) group] and 24 sex- and age-matched children scoring at a high level compared to peers [high-attentional skills (HAS) group]. The two groups were compared on a series of cognitive tasks to assess executive function (EF). The LAS group performed within the typical range yet at a significantly lower level than the HAS group on the majority of the EF tasks administered, namely working memory and inhibition measures, even though there were no significant differences between the groups on a measure of intellectual ability. Working memory measures followed by measures of inhibition emerged as the best predictors of group membership. These findings provide empirical evidence that there are individual differences in attentional skills. Specifically, that there is a relationship between behavioural inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity and cognitive performance on working memory and inhibitory control tasks.}

Children with autism and matched verbal mental age (VMA) controls were presented with a series of counterfactual syllogisms, in two conditions. One condition (Counterfactual plus Pretence) involved prompting the child's imagination during the reasoning task, whereas the other condition (Counterfactual Only) included no such prompting. Results showed that both normal 4-5-year-old children, and children with moderate learning difficulties improved in their reasoning performance when prompted to use imagination. This replicates and extends findings from Dias \& Harris (1990). In children with autism, however, performance was good in the Counterfactual Only condition, but became worse when imagination was prompted. These results show that although abstract counterfactual reasoning appears intact in children with autism, their counterfactual reasoning is not facilitated by pretence in the normal way.}

Using a sample of 111 anxious children (Mage = 9.63, SD = 0.73; 75.7\% girls; 56\% Hispanic/Latino), we found that cognitive distortions were negatively related to social competence. In addition, tests of moderated mediation showed that the negative association between cognitive distortions and social skill competence was indirect via reluctance to express emotion, but this only was the case for anxious children with high attention control and for distortions in the academic domain. The findings of this study may set the stage for new ways to conceptualize the role of higher attention control among anxious youth. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject?

  abstract = {Las oportunidades de desarrollo adecuado y de inclusión social de aquellos niños y jóvenes que viven en condiciones de vulnerabilidad social, suelen reducirse significativamente por la presencia de múltiples factores de riesgo en sus contextos de crianza y de educación durante las primeras dos décadas de vida (Bradley y Corwyn, 2002; Brooks-Gunn y Duncan, 1997; Farah y cols., 2008; Hackman y Farah, 2009; McLoyd, 1998; Msall, 2005). Tales factores de riesgo pueden estar presentes en diferentes niveles de organización (i.e., individual, familiar y social), e involucrar tanto condiciones biológicas, psicológicas y sociales, como culturales. Entre el conjunto de factores que han sido asociados a la presencia de dificultades en las competencias cognitivas, emocionales y sociales, se encuentran los siguientes: la historia de salud peri y postnatal, la seguridad alimentaria, la educación materna, el estado marital y la salud mental de los padres, los sucesos de vida negativos en el hogar y en la escuela, la calidad de la estimulación en el hogar, las interacciones sociales en los contextos de crianza (e.g., hogar y escuela), la calidad estructural de la vivienda, el hacinamiento, y los modelos de roles sociales presentes en la comunidad (Bradley y Corwyn, 2002; Brooks-Gunn y Duncan, 1997; Burchinal y cols., 2000; Gassman-Pines y Yoshikawa, 2006; Hackman y Farah, 2009). Es decir que las asociaciones entre los antecedentes socioeconómicos y las competencias cognitivas, emocionales y sociales no involucran sólo al ingreso, a los niveles de educación y ocupación de los padres y a las condiciones de las viviendas, sino también a otros factores como la salud, la calidad del ambiente familiar y escolar, la calidad de las interacciones entre adultos y niños, las características de los barrios y el apoyo de diferentes redes sociales (Bradley y Corwyn, 2002, 2005; Engle y cols., 2007; Farah y cols., 2008; Gassman-pinos y Yoshikawa, 2006; Grantham-McGregor y cols., 2007). Asimismo, la probabilidad de evidenciar dificultades en dichas áreas del desarrollo así como en la adquisición de aprendizajes, puede ser modulada no solo por aspectos cuantitativos (e.g., acumulación de factores de riesgo) y/o cualitativos (e.g., calidad de la estimulación cognitiva en el hogar) de tales factores, sino además, por el momento del desarrollo en el cual éstos se presentan por primera vez, su perdurabilidad en el tiempo y la susceptibilidad de cada individuo frente a ellos (Aber y cols., 2003; Appleyard y cols., 2005; Bradley y Corwyn, 2002; Brooks-Gunn y Duncan, 1997; Burchinal y cols., 2000; Duncan y cols., 1994; Evans, 2004; Gassman-Pines y Yoshikawa, 2006; McLeod Y Shanahan, 1993; McLloyd, 1998; Miller y Korenman, 1994; Stanton-Chapman y cols., 2004; Walker y cols., 2007). Por ejemplo, en diferentes investigaciones efectuadas durante las últimas dos décadas en el estudio del impacto de la pobreza sobre el desarrollo cognitivo, se ha podido establecer que: (1) la pobreza experimentada en la infancia temprana tiene un mayor impacto en la adolescencia, que la pobreza experimentada sólo en la adolescencia; (2) más allá de que el impacto temprano y sostenido de la pobreza en algunas áreas del desarrollo (e.g., competencias cognitivas y sociales), puede tener consecuencias perdurables que afectan a las personas durante todo su ciclo vital, la pobreza puede afectar el desarrollo en cualquiera de sus etapas, no habiéndose identificado aún períodos sensibles para tales impactos; (3) la frecuencia de la exposición a la pobreza (i.e., cantidad de veces durante el ciclo vital), tiene un mayor impacto en comparación con el momento de su exposición. Es interesante destacar, que en base a este tipo de información algunos investigadores sugieren que las intervenciones orientadas a optimizar las oportunidades de desarrollo cognitivo de poblaciones infantiles en riesgo social por pobreza, deberían sostenerse durante mucho más tiempo que los primeros tres o cinco años, hasta por lo menos la primera o las dos primeras décadas de vida (Lipina y Colombo, 2009; Najman y cols., 2009). En cuanto al análisis del impacto de los factores de riesgo sobre el desempeño escolar, la mayoría de los estudios han evaluado impactos en un único punto en el tiempo o bien cambios entre dos momentos L Consideraciones Metodológicas y Conceptuales para el Análisis de Predicción del Desempeño Escolar en Base a Indicadores del Contexto Hogareño y Escolar María Soledad Segretin, Sebastián J. Lipina y Daniel Roberto Petetta 106 diferentes durante el desarrollo. Dichos estudios proponen que la comprensión de los factores que afectan al desempeño académico de los niños en distintos momentos de su desarrollo y procesos de escolaridad, podría ayudar a explicar por qué los niños con exposición a mayor cantidad de factores de riesgo alcanzan o no a sus pares en sus niveles de desempeño. Los resultados de algunos de estos estudios sugieren, al igual que en los estudios sobre el desempeño cognitivo o el estado de salud, que ello se debería a la combinación de múltiples factores acumulados y no el efecto de una única variable (Gutman y cols., 2003). En particular, la asociación entre pobreza e impacto sobre los desempeños académicos en las áreas de matemática y lengua, ha sido verificada en tanto mediada por los niveles de estimulación y de contención emocional en el hogar, en las fases de educación inicial y escolar, así como también a problemas de conducta en la fase de la adolescencia, estimulación académica de los padres, y calidad del vecindario (Keegan Eamon, 2002, 2005). Tales tipos de impactos negativos han sido verificados en general por medio de indicadores como la retención o repetición de grado, tasa de graduación, deserción, años de educación completados y por medio de la administración de pruebas de desempeño estandarizadas (Bradley y Corwyn, 2002; Brooks-Gunn y Duncan, 1997; McLoyd, 1998). Respecto a los tipos de abordajes analíticos aplicados a la evaluación del impacto de la pobreza sobre el desempeño cognitivo y escolar, éstos han sido efectuados por lo general en base a los siguientes: (1) análisis de sumatoria cuadrados múltiple (regresión múltiple en base a variables individuales), que predicen el desempeño en base a variables de riesgo individuales como educación materna, ingreso, salud mental parental o prácticas de crianza; (2) análisis de sumatoria de cuadrados (regresión múltiple en base a factores), que predicen impactos en base a factores (conjuntos de variables de riesgo correlacionadas); (3) análisis de regresión en base a índices de riesgo generados en base a una serie de variables de riesgo presentes en la vida de los niños y jóvenes; y (4) análisis de ecuación estructural, que evalúan el ajuste de los datos a diferentes modelos teóricos. Si bien todos estos abordajes difieren tanto en sus ventajas -por ejemplo, el primer modelo permite evaluar la importancia relativa de cada variable de riesgo, mientras que el segundo permite identificar factores relevantes- como en sus desventajas -por ejemplo, la superposición entre los predictores en el caso del primer abordaje, o el descarte de información en el segundo y tercer abordajes-, todos ellos han posibilitado verificar que los niños y jóvenes expuestos a múltiples factores de riesgo, tienen mayor probabilidad de manifestar alteraciones en sus desempeños cognitivos y escolares (Burchinal y cols., 2000; Gassman-Pines y Yoshikawa, 2006). Finalmente, en cuanto a la medición de la pobreza infantil, en los últimos años se han desarrollado una variedad de enfoques con el objetivo de generar una herramienta de medición que contemple las necesidades de los niños de manera específica, teniendo en cuenta los aportes de las teorías de desarrollo infantil. Ejemplos de ello son la identificación de privaciones moderadas y severas propuesto por Gordon y cols. (2003) y el de los índices de pobreza (Roelen y Gassman, 2008), ambos basados en la consideración de múltiples dimensiones del fenómeno de la pobreza infantil pero teniendo en cuenta fundamentalmente las necesidades materiales, sociales y de desarrollo de los niños. En ambos abordajes, la elección inicial de los dominios e indicadores se basa en la perspectiva conceptual multidimensional de la pobreza infantil, una de cuyas dificultades reside en la disponibilidad de información. No obstante, la utilización de índices propone dos ventajas de importancia: (1) la síntesis de diversos indicadores en distintos ámbitos: y (2) la producción de un único número que simplifica la comunicación. En consecuencia, este tipo de abordaje resulta muy útil para hacer comparaciones entre regiones o países, si bien presenta como principal desventaja la necesidad de una amplia cantidad de información o casos en cada dimensión involucrada (Roelen y Gassman, 2008). Consideraciones Metodológicas y Conceptuales para el Análisis de Predicción del Desempeño Escolar en Base a Indicadores del Contexto Hogareño y Escolar María Soledad Segretin, Sebastián J. Lipina y Daniel Roberto Petetta 107 El objetivo principal de este trabajo consiste en la aplicación y valoración de un modelo de análisis de la asociación entre factores de riesgo provenientes de diferentes contextos de desarrollo (hogar y escuela) y el desempeño escolar de alumnos de diferentes ciclos de educación. En términos específicos, se propone (1) caracterizar los perfiles de desempeño escolar en las áreas de matemática y lengua, de alumnos de educación básica y secundaria en función a sus condiciones de vida, edad, género y contexto escolar (incluyendo distritos); (2) identificar factores de riesgo del desempeño escolar (predictores) y su modulación por diferentes variables independientes referidas a condiciones de vida y contexto escolar; y (3) generar una metodología de análisis (índice) para identificar predictores de riesgo de bajo desempeño escolar en las áreas de matemática y lengua, aplicable a otras bases de datos del mismo tipo. Si bien es esperable encontrar una asociación significativa entre carencias en las condiciones de vida y tales desempeños, tal como la extensa literatura en el área lo prueba, la finalidad del análisis que aquí se propone es su potencial aplicación en contextos de investigación educativa, así como también su contribución al diseño de estrategias de intervenciones públicas y/o curriculares en términos de reducir impactos de la inequidad educativa en diferentes ciclos educativos.},

  abstract = {The association between socioeconomic status and child cognitive development, and the positive impact of interventions aimed at optimizing cognitive performance, are well-documented. However, few studies have examined how specific socio-environmental factors may moderate the impact of cognitive interventions among poor children. In the present study, we examined how such factors predicted cognitive trajectories during the preschool years, in two samples of children from Argentina, who participated in two cognitive training programs (CTPs) between the years 2002 and 2005: the School Intervention Program (SIP; N = 745) and the Cognitive Training Program (CTP; N = 333). In both programs children were trained weekly for 16 weeks and tested before and after the intervention using a battery of tasks assessing several cognitive control processes (attention, inhibitory control, working memory, flexibility and planning). After applying mixed model analyses, we identified sets of socio-environmental predictors that were associated with higher levels of pre-intervention cognitive control performance and with increased improvement in cognitive control from pre- to post-intervention. Child age, housing conditions, social resources, parental occupation and family composition were associated with performance in specific cognitive domains at baseline. Housing conditions, social resources, parental occupation, family composition, maternal physical health, age, group (intervention/control) and the number of training sessions were related to improvements in specific cognitive skills from pre- to post-training.},

The present study teased apart the influences of fantasy context, an obligation rule, and a rationale, which typically were confounded in previous research. Subjects were 165 10- and 11-year-olds, who were asked to solve a modified version of Wason's selection task. Conditions differed with respect to the context supplied in the problem. Significantly more children in the fantasy than the non-fantasy conditions gave correct anticipatory responses, gave correct global solutions, and were able to solve the problem quickly. Neither an obligation rule nor a rationale had any significant effect, unless presented in conjunction with a fantasy context. Results are discussed in terms of the important role of fantasy in discouraging reliance on empirical knowledge in reasoning about conditionals.}

Participants were n = 163 children (82 boys and 81 girls) aged 23–77 months (M = 53.29, SD = 14.48), recruited from preschools in Italy. Parents provided ratings of child shyness and teachers rated children's socio-emotional functioning at preschool (i.e., social competence, anxiety-withdrawal, peer rejection). Children were also interviewed to assess their abilities to recognize facial emotional expressions and identify situations that affect emotions. Among the results, shyness was positively related to anxiety-withdrawal and peer rejection. In addition, emotion recognition was found to significantly moderate the links between shyness and preschool socio-emotional functioning, appearing to serve a buffering role. For example, at lower levels of emotion recognition, shyness was positively associated with both anxiety-withdrawal and rejection by peers, but at higher levels of emotion recognition, these associations were attenuated. Results are discussed in terms of the protective role of emotion recognition in promoting shy children's positive socio-emotional functioning within the classroom context.},

Children 18–21 months of age were genotyped for the               DRD4               48 base pair tandem repeat polymorphism, which has been implicated in the development of attention, sensation seeking, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The children also interacted with their caregiver for 10~min in a laboratory setting, and these videotaped interactions were coded for parenting quality using an observational rating procedure. The presence of the               DRD4               7-repeat allele was associated with differences in the influence of parenting on a measure of temperamental sensation seeking constructed from caregiver reports on children's activity level, impulsivity, and high-intensity pleasure. Children with the 7-repeat allele were influenced by parenting quality, with lower quality parenting associated with higher levels of sensation seeking; children without the 7-repeat allele were uninfluenced by parenting quality. Differences between alleles were not related to the child's self-regulation as assessed by the effortful control measure. Previous studies have indicated that the 7-repeat allele is under positive selective pressure, and our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the               DRD4               7-repeat allele increased children's sensitivity to environmental factors such as parenting. This study shows that genes influence the relation between parenting and temperament in ways that are important to normal development and psychopathology.},

  abstract = {Before 9 months, infants use sound to retrieve a stationary object hidden by darkness but not one hidden by occlusion, suggesting auditory input is more salient in the absence of visual input. This article addresses how audiovisual input affects 10-month-olds’ search for displaced objects. In AB tasks, infants who previously retrieved an object at A subsequently fail to find it after it is displaced to B, especially following a delay between hiding and retrieval. Experiment 1 manipulated auditory input by keeping the hidden object audible versus silent, and visual input by presenting the delay in the light versus dark. Infants succeeded more at B with audible than silent objects and, unexpectedly, more after delays in the light than dark. Experiment 2 presented both the delay and search phases in darkness. The unexpected light–dark difference disappeared. Across experiments, the presence of auditory input helped infants find displaced objects, whereas the absence of visual input did not. Sound might help by strengthening object representation, reducing memory load, or focusing attention. This work provides new evidence on when bimodal input aids object processing, corroborates claims that audiovisual processing improves over the first year of life, and contributes to multisensory approaches to studying cognition. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject Before 9 months, infants use sound to retrieve a stationary object hidden by darkness but not one hidden by occlusion. This suggests they find auditory input more salient in the absence of visual input in simple search tasks. After 9 months, infants’ object processing appears more sensitive to multimodal (e.g., audiovisual) input. What does this study add? This study tested how audiovisual input affects 10-month-olds’ search for an object displaced in an AB task. Sound helped infants find displaced objects in both the presence and absence of visual input. Object processing becomes more sensitive to bimodal input as multisensory functions develop across the first year.},

  abstract = {Accurate measurement of a child’s executive functioning (EF) is important for diagnosis, description of functional impairment, and treatment planning. EF assessment typically consists of administration of a battery of performance-based tests involving abilities such as attention, inhibition, reasoning, planning, and mental flexibility. In recent years, observer (e.g., parent) rating scales have been added to the typical EF battery. However, research has revealed that performance-based tests and parent rating scales are not highly correlated. In other words, level of impairment indicated by one source of data often does not match level of impairment indicated by the other source of data. This disagreement places the clinician in a difficult situation when attempting to interpret evaluation results. The profession of pediatric neuropsychology needs to provide guidance about handling this disagreement. Using the current assessment tools, specific EF subdomains may need to be examined systematically to identify precisely where the disagreements lie. Perhaps the relative validity of the two data sources can be determined, and decisions can be made about what to emphasize and what/when to interpret cautiously. Alternatively, perhaps the goal should be to develop and/or refine measurement tools to increase agreement in order to improve accuracy and validity of test interpretation. At this time, the results of performance-based tests and rating scales of EF are being used together but are not being integrated. Evidence-based practice requires that more work be done to enhance the use of these two sources of data.},

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the four conceptualized coping self-efficacy domains: self-efficacy for proactive behaviour, self-efficacy for avoiding aggressive behaviour, self-efficacy for avoiding self-blame, and self-efficacy for victim-role disengagement. Internal consistencies for the coping domains were between .87 and .90. Validity was examined by correlations between the coping self-efficacy domains and psychological adjustment variables. Greater coping self-efficacy was associated with less social anxiety, cognitive depression, and externalizing symptoms. The Peer Aggression Coping Self-Efficacy Scale provides a useful measure for examining children's self-efficacy for using a range of strategies to deal with peer aggression.}

This longitudinal community study of 960 Norwegian 4-year-olds, followed up at ages 6 and 8, examined bidirectional relations between screen use and emotion understanding. Results revealed that more screen time at age 4 predicted lower levels of emotion understanding at age 6. In addition, television in children's bedroom at age 6 forecasted lower levels of emotion understanding at age 8. The effect of TV watching on emotion understanding was gender moderated, with stronger effects of TV watching observed among girls, but no significant effects detected among boys. In contrast, gaming forecasted lower level of emotion understanding in boys, not girls. Results are discussed in the light of the importance of face-to-face interaction to preserve the development of social-emotional competence among young children. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? We know that children's screen activities correlate with poorer social competence and with decrease of the quantity and quality of interaction with parents and siblings. The capacity to understand emotions in others is primarily learned through interaction with primary caregivers, but little is known how children's screen use influences development of emotion understanding. What the present study adds? We found that more TV watching among girls at age 4 predicted lower levels of emotion understanding at age 6. Furthermore, TV in child's bedroom at age 6 forecasted lower levels of emotion understanding at age 8.},

  abstract = {The preschool period is marked by rapid growth of children's self‐regulation and related executive functions. Self‐regulation is considered an important aspect of school readiness and is related to academic and social–emotional outcomes in childhood. Pretend play, as part of the early childhood curriculum, is hypothesized to support self‐regulation. An important question concerns whether self‐regulation should be considered an individual ability or, partly, a situated skill that is influenced by aspects of the classroom context. The aims of this study were to investigate the degree to which 3‐year‐olds showed cognitive and emotional self‐regulation in a naturalistic play setting and to examine how test‐based measures of children's cool and hot executive functions and the quality of their pretend play contributed to this observed selfregulation. The results indicated that 3‐year‐olds showed aspects of cognitive and emotional self‐regulation. Cool executive functions appeared significantly related to emotional self‐regulation, whereas hot executive functions were not significantly related to cognitive or emotional self‐regulation. The quality of pretend play was strongly associated with cognitive self‐regulation and, to a lesser extent, emotional self‐regulation. The findings of this study suggest that both preschoolers' cool executive functions and the quality of play contributed to their self‐regulation skills in naturalistic settings.},

  abstract = {In empirical research, developmentalists attribute knowledge to children on the basis of performances on assessment tasks. Since knowledge is not itself observable, criteria are needed for reasonable decisions to be made about how to classify different intellectual states, such as false belief, empirically true belief, necessary knowledge. In Piagetian research, there are two distinct views about the selection of such ‘response criteria’. One view states that knowledge can be attributed on the basis of children's judgements-alone (J-view). A contrary view states that such attribution requires children to justify their judgements (JJ-view). An objection to the J-view is discussed by consideration of the two dominant philosophical accounts as to the nature of knowledge, namely the foundationalist and causal accounts. It is argued, firstly, that the foundationalist account requires the elimination of the J-view with which it is incompatible through its failure to deal with cases of knowledge at all. It is argued, secondly, that the causal account places a limitation on the J-view which fails to deal with cases of necessary knowledge. Since one of the main problems in Piagetian research is the construction of necessary knowledge, only the JJ-view should be used when this problem is addressed. Developmental research which is based on the J-view alone could not, without circularity, be concerned with the substantive issues which are outside its conceptual scope.}

  abstract = {Researchers in early social-cognition have found that the ability to reverse an ambiguous figure is correlated with success on theory of mind tasks (e.g. Gopnik \& Rosati, 2001). The present experiment examined children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) without mental delay to see whether a similar relationship existed. Ropar, Mitchell, and Ackroyd (2003)demonstrated that children with ASD with mental delay were impaired on theory of mind tasks, but were as likely as mentally delayed controls to generate both interpretations of an ambiguous figure when informed of its ambiguity. The present study replicated this finding on children with ASD without mental delay. However, overall perception of ambiguous figures was different. These children were less likely to spontaneously generate both interpretations of the figure, and more likely to perseverate on a single interpretation than the comparison children. Like Ropar et al., we found no correlation between theory of mind and informed reversals, but spontaneous reversals were correlated with performance on an advanced theory of mind task. These data suggest that reversals of ambiguous figures are linked to higher-level representational abilities, which might also be involved in social functioning, and impaired in children with ASD.}

  abstract = {Researchers who advocate the hypothesis that cognitive development is akin to theory formation have also suggested that young children possess distinct systems for explaining physical, psychological, and biological principles (see, e.g., Wellman \& Gelman, 1992). One way this has been investigated is by examining how children explain human action: Children explain intentional and accidental actions by appealing to psychological principles, and explain impossible physical or biological action in terms of the underlying principles of those domains (Schult \& Wellman, 1997). The current investigation examined the coherence of children's explanatory systems by eliciting explanations of possible and impossible physical, psychological, and biological events. Then, in a separate set of stories, children were asked to generate counterfactual alternatives for characters who wanted to perform an event, but did not, either because of a mishap or because the event was impossible. Overall, children were better at generating explanations for why events were impossible than recognizing that no alternative could be generated for impossible events. However, there was some evidence that children's explanatory abilities predicted whether they could correctly reject cases where no counterfactual alternative could be generated. The results lend support to the hypothesis that children's causal knowledge is coherently organized in domain-specific knowledge structures.}

However, their early physiological and social–emotional correlates have not been examined simultaneously. We tested whether children's skin conductance level, anger regulation, and trust in others were differentially related to their proactive and reactive aggression. Four-year-olds and their primary caregivers were recruited from a large Canadian city (N = 150). Controlling for reactive aggression, higher trust was associated with lower proactive aggression, but only for children with low anger regulation or skin conductance level. Controlling for proactive aggression, lower anger regulation was related to higher reactive aggression, and higher trust was related to higher reactive aggression for children with high skin conductance level. Findings highlight the unique and collective relations of physiology, emotion regulation, and trust to different forms of aggression in early childhood. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject Proactive and reactive aggression subtypes are distinguishable as early as the preschool years. Unique physiological and social–emotional correlates of each subtype have been studied in middle and late childhood. Trust is a critical milestone for positive social interactions in early childhood and has been linked to aggression. What the present study adds Physiological and social–emotional correlates are uniquely linked to subtypes of aggression already at age 4. Trust is differentially linked to aggression subtypes as a function of anger regulation and skin conductance level.},

  abstract = {Two experiments with 3- and 5-year-old children investigated the development of indirect search strategies. Two components of indirect search were evaluated: the acquisition of indirect search information and the utilization of that information to target further searches effectively. Even 3-year-olds showed some use of both components of indirect search, although they were more likely than 5-year-olds to search in places where previous indirect searches had indicated the target object could not be. An intriguing aspect of the results was that children were not necessarily any more efficient in their indirect searches than they would have been with a direct approach to the problem. This suggests that children actively strive to develop strategies for solving problems intelligently, even when those strategies do not produce any immediate improvement over direct or rote procedures.}

The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised was used to measure intellectual functioning and the Teacher's Report Form to assess teacher-reported behavioural and emotional problems. Overall, patients had IQ scores that fell within the normal range. The total sample of ConHD children (N = 117, 7–16 years old), however, obtained significantly lower mean scores on Verbal IQ and Verbal Comprehension than reference children. When compared with same-aged reference peers from the general population, 7–11-year-old ConHD children obtained significantly lower mean scores on Total IQ, Verbal IQ, Verbal Comprehension, and Perceptual Organization. In contrast, scores of 12–16-year-old ConHD children appeared to be significantly lower on Verbal Comprehension only and significantly higher on Performance IQ. No significant differences were found in intellectual functioning between ConHD boys and girls, nor between different diagnostic groups. The school-related behavioural and emotional adjustment of this sample of children with treated ConHD was favourable. Overall, this sample of recently treated ConHD children, and especially children aged 7–11 years, showed poorer intellectual functioning in several areas. These findings deserve further attention.}

  abstract = {Seven-month-old infants’ haptic perception of texture was examined using visually identical smooth and rough textures. Forty-eight infants participated in a familiarization-novelty-return-to-familiar procedure. Following familiarization, experimental infants received a novel texture (either rough or smooth) during the novelty phase and the original texture from the familiarization phase was presented in the return-to-familiar phase. Control infants received the same texture, either rough or smooth, throughout the three phases. For half of the infants in each of the groups the stimuli were occluded by an opaque cover. For the remaining infants, stimuli were visible through a transparent cover. Infants were allowed to freely explore the textures in each phase. Manual contact (touching and grasping), bimanual contact, scrumbling, fingering, and total visual attention and fixation were measured. The findings suggest that: (i) processing of texture may take longer than indicated in past literature; infants in both the experimental and control groups maintained high levels of manual contact throughout the three phases; (ii) 7-month-old infants may, nonetheless, be capable of making texture discriminations; experimental infants’ responses during the return-to-familiar phase were indicative of recognition memory for the familiarization texture; (iii) infants use more efficient exploratory hand strategies when texture stimuli are not visible; and (iv) while vision appears to increase total visual attention, to direct visual fixation and to direct both hands towards the stimuli, it does not facilitate haptic perception of texture.}

The intervention was implemented during the child's first year of life in mixed families (i.e. adoptive families with biological children) and in all-adoptive families (i.e. adoptive families without biological children). In the small sample of mixed families (N = 35), we found delayed positive intervention effects at age 7 on ego-resiliency and optimal ego-control in girls, and on internalizing behaviour problems in both boys and girls. In all-adoptive families (N = 112), the intervention had been effective in changing maternal sensitive responsiveness, security of attachment, and infant exploratory competence in early childhood, but enduring intervention effects could not be traced at the child's age of 7.}

The sample comprised 200 non-clinical children, aged 9–13 years, and their parents (mothers and fathers). Results revealed that the effect of parental AS on children's AS is moderated by the children's EI for maternal AS and by their femininity traits for paternal AS. Learning experiences following somatic sensations influenced the children's level of AS. More specifically, special attention by parents following a child's somatic sensations (reinforcement and transmission of information) was associated with high AS in children. Parental reactions of fear following a parent's somatic sensations (modelling) seem to predict higher scores for AS when the link is moderated by the child's femininity orientation. The implications of these findings are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject The influence of parental factors in child's AS has been demonstrate, but these studies are limited. Specific mechanisms might condition the relationship between child's AS and parental factors. What does this study add? Learning experiences and parental AS influence the child's level of AS. It is important to consider the influence of mothers and fathers in child's AS. Child's emotional intelligence and expressive traits may moderate the effect of parental factors.},

These inconsistencies have been surprisingly little noted in the literature and present a particular problem to researchers seeking to study parenting in little examined cultures. This article describes these inconsistencies, and suggests some practical resolutions based on the writers' recent experience of studying parenting in Islamic cultures. Some dilemmas and choice points described are: the use of typologies vs. dimensions; measures of parenting styles vs. practices; the limited number of items in most current scales of ‘style’ as opposed to ‘practice’ domains; strategies to assess the validity of parenting practices when the culture-specific ‘meaning’ of the behaviour is not known; and the implications of the greater degree of gender differentiation in cultures studied. Steps proposed as criteria for assembling scales and determining psychometric acceptability when adapting measures to new cultures are outlined. It is the goal of this article to raise discussion both about the inconsistencies and lack of standardization of measures in the study of parenting, and about guidelines for future studies charting new territory. Such discussion is timely as developmental psychology takes on an increasingly global perspective.}

In the triadic situation, infants’ monitoring of a social partner in various situations of object exploration was recorded. Results indicated that specific responses in a dyadic context correlate with responses expressed by the infant in a triadic context. At either age, infants that demonstrated attempts to re-engage the experimenter during the still-face episode in the dyadic situation were also those who manifested the most signs of joint engagement, attention following and attention monitoring in the triadic situation.

  abstract = {Children from different socioeconomic backgrounds have differing abilities to delay gratification, and impoverished children have the greatest difficulties in doing so. In the present study, we examined the role of vagal tone in predicting the ability to delay gratification in both resource-rich and resource-poor environments. We derived hypotheses from evolutionary models of children’s conditional adaptation to proximal rearing contexts. In Study 1, we tested whether elevated vagal tone was associated with shorter delay of gratification in impoverished children. In Study 2, we compared the relative role of vagal tone across two groups of children, one that had experienced greater impoverishment and one that was relatively middle-class. Results indicated that in resource-rich environments, higher vagal tone was associated with longer delay of gratification. In contrast, high vagal tone in children living in resource-poor environments was associated with reduced delay of gratification. We interpret the results with an eye to evolutionary-developmental models of the function of children’s stress-response system and adaptive behavior across varying contexts of economic risk.},

  abstract = {Humans excel at mirroring both others’ actions (imitation) as well as others’ goals and intentions (emulation). As most research has focused on imitation, here we focus on how social and asocial learning predict the development of goal emulation. We tested 215 preschool children on two social conditions (imitation, emulation) and two asocial conditions (trial-and-error and recall) using two touch screen tasks. The tasks involved responding to either three different pictures in a specific picture order (Cognitive: apple→boy→cat) or three identical pictures in a specific spatial order (Motor-Spatial: up→down→right). Generalized linear models demonstrated that during the preschool years, Motor-Spatial emulation is associated with social and asocial learning, while cognitive emulation is associated only with social learning, including motor-spatial emulation and multiple forms of imitation. This result contrasts with those from a previous study using this same data set showing that motor-spatial and cognitive imitation were neither associated with one another nor, generally, predicted by other forms of social or asocial learning. Together, these results suggests that while developmental changes in imitation are associated with multiple – specialized – mechanisms, developmental changes in emulation are associated with age-related changes and a more unitary, domain-general mechanism that receives input from several different cognitive and learning processes, including some that may not necessarily be specialized for social learning.},

Eighty-two children were asked to report what they did yesterday and what they are going to do tomorrow. Children who could answer one were also more likely to answer the other question. Furthermore, there was an association between the quantity of responses for past and future questions. This correlation continued to be significant even when controlling for children's capacity to answer similar questions that did not have a temporal, episodic component (e.g., ‘tell me all the things that you can think of that are red’). Together, these results are in line with the growing evidence for fundamental links in the neuro-cognitive resources involved in thinking about past and future events.}

  abstract = {Using a standard prediction of action task, we find that normally developing 3-yearold children successfully take into account a protagonist's false belief when asked a ‘look first’ question. When asked this same question in a true belief scenario, 3-yearolds also correctly predict a protagonist's action even though in this case the correct answer is the second (full) location rather than the first (empty) location. This rules out the use of a low-level response strategy. In a second experiment, children aged 3.5 years who failed a standard ‘think’ question passed a ‘look first’ question. A control group of older children with autism, who performed at the 3.5-year-old level on the ‘think’ question, showed no improvement in performance on the ‘look first’ question. Taken together, the two studies confirm that a minimal modification to the standard false belief task helps normally developing preschoolers to calculate the content of a false belief. Current neuropsychological models of ‘theory of mind’ development typically contrast autistic children with normally developing 4-year-olds who pass standard false belief tasks. Our present results extend current models by comparing autistic children with 3-year-olds who also fail standard tasks. Apparently, the two groups do not fail for the same reasons. Whereas 3-year-olds’ difficulties on theory of mind tasks appear to be due to performance factors, autistic children's difficulties appear to be caused by a deeper metarepresentational impairment.}

  abstract = {Studies with infants show divergence between performance on theory of mind tasks depending on whether direct or indirect measures are used. It has been suggested that direct measures assess a flexible but cognitively demanding ability to reason about the minds of others, whereas indirect measures assess distinct processes which afford more efficient but less flexible theory of mind abilities (Apperly \& Butterfill, 2009). This leads to the prediction that performance on indirect measures should be subject to signature limits. The current study tested whether the Level-1/Level-2 distinction might constitute one such limit. The study adapted a task that has shown evidence of Level-1 perspective-taking on both direct and indirect measures (Samson, Apperly, Braithwaite, Andrews, \& Bodley-Scott, 2010). The aim was to test Level-2 perspective-taking in a sample of 6- to 11-year-olds (N = 80) and adults (N = 20). Participants were able to make Level-2 judgements on the direct measure. In contrast with the findings from Level-1 perspective-taking, there was no evidence of automatic processing of Level-2 perspectives on the indirect measure. This finding is consistent with the view that theory of mind abilities assessed by indirect measures are subject to signature limits. The Level-1/Level-2 distinction, suitably refined, marks one way in which efficient but inflexible theory of mind abilities are limited.}

Data were drawn from a prospective longitudinal study of 1,201 infants. As found in previous studies, socio-demographic characteristics and maternal caregiving (especially ‘opportunities for stimulation’) were significant predictors of all child outcomes. There were also effects of quantity of individual and group care, and quality of non-maternal care. Controlling for demographics and maternal caregiving, more hours of group care (nurseries) were related to higher cognitive scores, while more hours of individual care (e.g., grandparents, nannies etc.) were related to lower orientation/engagement scores. Non-maternal caregiving was observed in a subsample of 345 children, and after controlling for all covariates as well as quantity and stability of care, quality of care was found to be predictive of higher cognitive ability and better orientation/engagement. Although the effect sizes were small in magnitude, in line with other similar studies, such modest effects from a large English sample are important when viewed in light of the widespread use of non-maternal care during infancy and early childhood.}

Comments specific to the mental states of the story characters and discourse after the book had ended were positively related to children's ToM, and this was due to parent elaborations. Studies 2 and 3 examined children's mental state discourse during story-telling tasks, and in both, mental state discourse of children during narrative was concurrently related to ToM performance. While research has shown that mental state discourse of parents is related to children's ToM acquisition, the current research indicates that children's spontaneous use of mental state language examined outside of the interactional context is also a strong correlate.}

  abstract = {The study investigated attentional processes of 32 preschool children with congenital visual impairment (VI). Children with profound visual impairment (PVI) and severe visual impairment (SVI) were compared to a group of typically developing sighted children in their ability to respond to adult directed attention in terms of establishing, maintaining, and shifting attention on toys. The measures of children's sensory-motor understanding (SMU) and language ability were obtained using the Reynell-Zinkin scales of mental development. The video-recordings of these play-based assessments were coded for three categories of behavioural responses (Establish, Maintain, and Shift). The three groups were matched on verbal comprehension (VC), but differed significantly in their SMU and their chronological age. The groups of children with PVI and SVI were found to be comparable in their ability to establish and maintain attention on objects. Despite a relatively good performance overall both groups scored significantly lower on those skills than children who were sighted. However, with regards to attention shifting, children with PVI showed significantly lower performance than both the children with SVI and the sighted children who were similar on this component. Ability to maintain and shift attention was significantly related to the cognitive ability of children with PVI; however the poorer attentional responses were not confined only to the children with low IQ. The results are discussed in relation to the role of vision, cognitive ability and executive function in attentional processes in children with congenital VI.}

The findings argue for closer attention to the developmental determinants of attitudes to institutional authority and strength of moral value commitments than these have received hitherto.

Boys expressed an intention to help fearful friends less often than sad friends and, in both sexes, the tendency to help diminished after a preceding angry episode. In justifying their answers the participants referred to their friend's emotional state in about 50\% of the cases and to their own emotional state in about 25\% of cases. References to the protagonist's angry mood state increased the probability that help was denied. Mentioning a friend's sad state almost exclusively was given as a reason for helping. In contrast, a friend's fearful behaviour was not only mentioned as a reason for providing help but was also given as a reason for withholding help, especially among boys.

Five- to seven-year-old children, ten- to twelve-year-old children and adults were instructed to push a doll across a small-scale road between two toy vehicles, which approached one after the other. We analysed the number of attempted crossings, the number of collisions, movement onset times and movement velocity control. The youngest children attempted to cross less often, but collided more frequently than the adults. This age effect could be attributed to differences in the way the children and adults controlled movement velocity. The youngest children attained the velocity that was required for safe travel too late, particularly when the gaps between the toy vehicles were small. The age differences in movement onset strategies were less clear-cut. The findings are discussed within a framework that proposes distinct roles of vision in action planning and action production.}

This study investigated whether EFs continue to develop during the later stages of adolescence: three related, yet separable EF components – inhibition, shifting, and working memory – were examined in a cross-sectional sample of 347 adolescents (aged 14–18 years). After adjusting for covariates, age was found to be a significant predictor of pupils’ performance on the inhibition but not the shifting or working memory tasks, suggesting different developmental trajectories for the three EF components. Controlling for non-executive processes implicated in performing the inhibition and working memory tasks had the most pronounced effect on the relationship between performance on those tasks and age. Finally, socioeconomic status was a significant predictor of performance on all tasks. Implications for research and practice are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Brain regions associated with EFs continue to mature throughout adolescence, implying ongoing development of EFs. Behavioural studies demonstrate that certain EFs have not yet reached their adult levels in early adolescence. What the present study adds Changes in inhibition, but not shifting or working memory task performance, are evident among older adolescents. Lower-order processes tapped by EF tasks act as confounds in the relationship between age and task performance. Socioeconomic status is a significant predictor of adolescents’ performance on EF tasks.},

  abstract = {When faced with shame, children can either respond in submissive ways to withdraw from their environment or in externalizing ways to oppose their environment. This study tested the hypothesis that fragile-positive views of self predispose children to respond in externalizing ways to shame situations. Narcissism, actual and perceived social preference, global self-worth and propensity towards externalizing shame responding were measured in 122 pre-adolescent children. As expected, results revealed that narcissism, in contrast to global self-worth, was associated with externalizing shame responding. In addition, actual but not perceived social preference was inversely related to externalizing shame responding, suggesting that the social self-perceptions of children prone to employ externalizing shame responses may be inflated. Discussion focuses on the self-regulatory function of externalizing shame responses.}

  abstract = {Two experiments were performed to investigate the effect of the order of drawing the head and trunk on the common tendency to exaggerate the size of the head in drawings of a man made by children aged 3 to 8 years. In Expt 1, all children were first asked to make a free drawing of a human figure. As expected, most children spontaneously drew the head before the trunk and overestimated the size of the head. Contrary to expectation, the greatest overestimation was found in the older age groups, not the youngest. The drawings of the children who drew the trunk before the head portrayed relatively smaller heads. All children were then asked to draw a head to complete a predrawn headless man, thus reversing the normal order of drawing the head before the trunk. A narrow neckline on the predrawn figure reduced the size of the added head, particularly in the youngest age group. On a predrawn figure without neck cues, the 5–6- and 7–8-year-old groups drew heads which were, on average, correctly proportioned and, therefore, smaller relative to the trunk than the heads portrayed in their free drawings. In Expt 2, children were asked to start their drawings with either the trunk or the head. When the head was drawn first, the children often left insufficient space for a visually correct depiction of the trunk, which was then drawn relatively too small. When the trunk was drawn first, the children always left enough space for the head and the figures were on average correctly proportioned. Thus the typical overestimation of the head seems to reflect the children's planning rather than their concept of the human figure.}

  abstract = {The study addresses the external validity of the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Ability (WJTCA) in learning disabled (LD) elementary school children by controlling for two methodological errors Woodcock identified in previous studies: (a) Intellectual ability range was restricted for both normal and LD samples to counteract an artificial inflation of mean WISC-R scores without concomitant effect on WJTCA scores, and (b) the WISC-R was readministered during data collection. In addition, normals were used as controls for LD students. WJTCA scores were correlated and compared with WISC-R scores and reading achievement test scores in 20 normal, 20 mild-to-moderate LD, and 20 severe LD third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students. Results indicate comparability of mean WISC-R and WJTCA Full Scale scores in the normal sample, but manifest a significantly lower WJTCA Full Scale scores in the LD samples, despite a strong degree of correlation between the two tests in each sample. The significant linear trend of increasing mean WISC-R/WJTCA discrepancy across the severity of LD strongly suggests that the lower WJTCA scores in the LD samples is a function of the instrument's achievement emphasis and refutes the possibility of systematic error in the WJTCA norms. Results suggest that the WJTCA's achievement emphasis jeopardizes its validity for assessing and classifying LD students within the currently accepted and mandated ability-achievement discrepancy model of specific learning disabilities.},

  abstract = {In two experiments, we investigated observational learning in social relationships as one possible pathway to the development of goal adjustment processes. In the first experiment, 56 children (M = 9.29 years) observed their parent as a model; in the second, 50 adults (M = 32.27 years) observed their romantic partner. Subjects were randomly assigned to three groups: goal engagement (GE), goal disengagement (GD), or control group (CO) and were asked to solve (unsolvable) puzzles. Before trying to solve the puzzles by themselves, subjects observed the instructed model, who was told to continue with the same puzzle (GE) or to switch to the next puzzle (GD). Results show that children in the GE group switched significantly less than in the GD or CO group. There was no difference between the GD group and CO group. Adults in the GE group switched significantly less than in the GD or CO group, whereas subjects in the GD group switched significantly more often than the CO group. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Previous research focused mainly on the functions of goal adjustment processes. It rarely considered processes and conditions that contribute to the development of goal engagement and goal disengagement. There are only two cross-sectional studies that directly investigate this topic. Previous research that claims observational learning as a pathway of learning emotion regulation or adjustment processes has (only) relied on correlational methods and, thus, do not allow any causal interpretations. Previous research, albeit claiming a life span focus, mostly investigated goal adjustment processes in one specific age group (mainly adults). There is no study that investigates the same processes in different age groups. What does this study add? In our two studies, we focus on the conditions of goal adjustment processes and sought to demonstrate one potential pathway of learning or changing the application of goal adjustment processes, namely observational learning. We employed an experimental design to study observational learning, instead of using a correlational design. The present studies are the first to apply an experimental design to investigate observational learning of adjustment processes. In our studies, we implemented the same design and studied the same process in different age groups. Thus, they expand knowledge beyond a particular age group and under a life span perspective.},

This study aimed to assess the criterion validity of a questionnaire investigating preschoolers’ sense of time from the points of view of their parents and teachers. One hundred seventy preschoolers were included in the sample. Their parents and teachers completed the Sense of Time Questionnaire, and the children were administered time reproduction and time discrimination tasks, both concurrently and 7 months later. The assessment of preschoolers’ sense of time reported by teachers, but not by parents, predicted the children's time processing skills both concurrently and longitudinally. The teacher version of the Sense of Time Questionnaire constitutes a valid instrument for assessing and predicting preschoolers’ time processing skills and can be used for clinical and research purposes Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Time processing difficulties are associated with developmental disorders such as ADHD and dyscalculia. Early assessment of time processing skills is important for clinical (e.g., screening) and research purposes. We do not have valid questionnaires for assessing sense of time in young children. What the present study adds? The sense of time ability reported by teachers predicts preschoolers’ time processing skills. The sense of time ability reported by parents does not predicts preschoolers’ time processing skills.

It is possible that, although the children can be guided to succeed on a training task, the failure to transfer is due to there being too great a mismatch between the task and their current unaided level of performance. This suggestion was tested by comparing the transfer of a forward search planning strategy acquired by groups of retarded childen when the mismatch between training and current competence was varied. In one comparison, two groups, matched on initial developmental level within the task domain, were trained on either the next or the next-but-one step in a developmental sequence. In a second comparison, two groups were trained at the same level in the developmental sequence. For one group this represented the next available step in the sequence, and for the other group it was the next-but-one step. In each comparison, although the pairs of groups required the same number of trials and hints to reach a learning criterion, only the group trained on the step adjacent to their current level of unaided performance showed transfer.}

  abstract = {Crying in early infancy is usually worse in the evening, peaks about six weeks after birth, and then gradually decreases, but it is not known why. This study tests the idea that the pattern of affect in early infancy is related to the development of circadian control over the sleep-wake cycle. Sleep and unhappy mood measures for a female infant were recorded in a diary by her parents for 210 consecutive days, starting a fortnight after her birth. Analysis of variance and cosinor analysis of the data revealed a circadian rhythm in unhappy mood that peaked in the evening, was present irrespective of food intake, and declined in strength after a few months. Developments in the diurnal pattern of unhappy mood were paralleled by increasing circadian rhythmicity in time of falling asleep and sleep duration. Regression analysis showed that unhappy mood was influenced by an interaction between time of sleep and duration of sleep. The results were in accord with recent research on mood in adults and suggest that the pattern of affect in early infancy may occur because the sleep-wake cycle is not yet aligned with the circadian timing system.}

The impact of concurrent maternal depressive symptoms was also considered. A secondary aim was to investigate the continuity of attachment classification at 15 months with child attachment representations at 4 years. Children of mothers who were concurrently depressed were more likely to have attachment representations characterized by uncontained physical aggression. In contrast, there were no significant relationships between exposure to prior chronic maternal depression and children's attachment representations at 4 years, nor were there any significant relationships between behavioural assessments of attachment during infancy and later representational assessments. Findings are discussed in the context of caregiving behaviours that may foster secure attachment relationships and influence a child's social-emotional development, limitations of representational measures, as well as poor attachment stability.}

The toddlers were observed in a triadic context so as to eliminate biases due to the alternation inherent in dyads that may lead to overestimation of turn-taking capacities. To control for variables such as birth order and familial status, the triads were not family members but included two same-age familiar toddlers and an adult experimenter. The exclusion of one of the toddlers from an ongoing dyadic interaction with the adult and the other child revealed an early mastery of turn taking and role shifting as well as an early understanding of social positions which lead to different communicative behaviour according to the position in the triad. Exclusion in triads is proposed as a paradigm for studying communicative skills and meta-communicative precursors in very young children.}

We used path analysis to examine the direct relationship between attachment security and matemal reports of sleep problems during toddlerhood and the degree to which sleep serves as a pathway linking attachment with subsequent teacher-reported emotional and behavioral problems. We also examined infant negative emotionality as a vulnerability factor that may potentiate attachment-sleep-adjustment outcomes. Data were drawn from 776 motherinfant dyads participating in the National Institute of Child and Human Development Study of Early Child Care. After statistically adjusting for mother and child characteristics, including child sleep and emotional and behavioral problems at 24 months, we found no evidence for a statistically significant direct path between attachment security and sleep problems at 36 months; however, there was a direct relationship between sleep problems at 36 months and internalizing problems at 54 months. Path models that examined the moderating influence of infant negative emotionality demonstrated significant direct relationships between attachment security and toddler sleep problems and between sleep problems and subsequent emotional and behavioral problems, but only among children characterized by high negative emotionality at 6 months. In addition, among this subset, there was a significant indirect path between attachment and intemalizing problems through sleep problems. These longitudinal findings implicate sleep as one critical pathway linking attachment security with adjustment difficulties, particularly among temperamentally vulnerable children.},

One hundred and sixty-six children between 3 and 6 years old completed the FB and picture-sequencing tasks, three executive function tasks (updating, inhibition, and shifting), and the receptive language test. The model with the best fit indicated that FB performance had a direct contribution from shifting of attention and inhibitory control, which was independent of the significant contribution made by picture sequencing. This model indicates that FB inference requires more executive processing than picture sequencing, which is used as an alternative task to measure theory of mind. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The majority of researchers use the false-belief task to assess mentalizing ability in young children. Sources of information used in various different mentalizing tasks require different levels of cognitive demand. Many executive functions (EFs) are involved in children's judgements of false belief. What does this study add? A statistical model was created to compare processing requirements of false-belief and picture-sequencing tasks. The model supported the claim that the false-belief task involves considerably more than just mentalizing. Shifting the focus of attention was an EF that was found to be a key component of performance in the false-belief task.},

  abstract = {Voltage-gated Na1 currents (INa) were analysed with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in human neuroblastoma NB69 cells plated in serum-free ‘‘defined’’ medium (DM) or in ‘‘astroglial-conditioned’’ medium (CM). Cells survived in both media and expressed the microtubule associated protein 1A, indicating neuron-like differentiation. Two INa types with different time-, voltage-dependent properties and tetrodotoxin (TTX) sensitivities were expressed in DM and CM. The INa in DM-plated cells was present from day 4 and its surface density increased from 11 pA/pF (days 5–7) to 68 pA/pF (days 15–30). The underlying conductance (GNa) half-activated (V0A) at 224 mV. INa inactivation was fitted by single exponentials with 7.5 ms time constant (th) at the 235 mV half-inactivation voltage (V0I). INa was not affected by 10 nM, was reduced (65\%) by 100 nM, and not completely abolished (92\%) by 300 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX). The INa of CM-plated cells appeared at day 3–4 and its surface density increased from 14 pA/pF (days 3–6) to 28 pA/pF (days 11–14). The GNa V0A was 229 mV and inactivation was fitted by single exponentials with 2.6 ms th at the 258 mV V0I. This INa was reduced (55\%) by 10 nM and totally abolished by 100 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX). In conclusion, NB69 cells displayed a slow, ‘‘TTX-resistant,’’ or a fast, ‘‘TTX-sensitive’’ INa in DM and CM, respectively, suggesting that the CM contained diffusible trophic factors of astroglial origin that induced the expression of a different Na1 channel type. About half of the CMand DM-plated cells also displayed a persistent Na1 current (INaP). GLIA 19:161–170, 1997. r 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In addition, we explored the relationships between response inhibition, working memory, and processing speed, as they are thought to be integral to cognitive control. Therefore, we assessed these three cognitive abilities in 159 children aged from 5 to 12. Results showed an improvement in response inhibition ability from 5 to 10 years of age. This improvement remained significant after controlling for the influence of working memory and processing speed. Furthermore, the developmental relationships showed an early differentiation between response inhibition, working memory, and processing speed. Thus, these processes were independent and need to be treated as such in further studies.}

Some gifted adolescents are known for their imbalance between high intellectual abilities and low emotional skills. Thus, this study aimed at examining the interplay between emotion and cognition in gifted and non-gifted adolescents. A stop-signal task, a response inhibition task including neutral, happy, or sad faces as signal triggering inhibition, was administered to 19 gifted and 20 typically developing male adolescents (12–18 years old). Gifted adolescents showed lower response inhibition abilities than non-gifted adolescents in the neutral and happy face conditions. Sad faces in gifted adolescents were associated with higher response inhibition compared to happy condition. In typically developing adolescents, emotional information (happy or sad faces) was related to lower response inhibition compared to neutral face condition. This study highlights that gifted adolescents present different self-regulation skills than their typically developing peers. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Some gifted adolescents present higher intellectual abilities alongside with lower socio-emotional skills. Self-regulation skills refer to processes allowing emotional and cognitive adaptation. Self-regulation skills might help to understand gifted adolescents, but remain scarcely studied. What does this study adds? Task-relevant emotional information impaired cognitive control in typically developing adolescents. Gifted adolescents are able to use sad faces to enhance their cognitive control abilities.},

The Interview for the Child Diagnostic Assessment was designed to evaluate children aged 4 to 12. It is a structured technique, which is administered to adults in charge of the minor and can be used in clinic, educational and forensic environments, as well as research tasks. Relieves sociodemographic data, development´s anamnesis, adaptive behavior and presence of risk and protective factors. Furthermore, it investigates symptoms associated with psychopathological disorders and problems that may be subject to clinical care,considering proposed by the DSM-5 (APA, 2014) criteria. In order to facilitate the formulation of diagnostic hypothesis, grids of the estimate of information obtained are included. The evaluation contemplates both the presence of disruptive as well as healthy behaviors, examines developmental milestones, areas affected by disease and those free of conflict. It also considers coping resources, Knowing this reality can address queries from a broader and more inclusive perspective.The aim of this presentation is to inform the designing and development steps of the instrument.

Infant characteristics such as anger proneness, cognitive competence, and attachment security were expected to be related to cortisol reactivity during the stressful event. The results showed higher cortisol reactivity in more anger-prone infants and in infants with higher levels of cognitive development as assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (N. Bayley, 1969). Attachment security, assessed with the Attachment Q-Set (AQS; E. Waters, 1995), was found to moderate the relation between cognitive level and cortisol reactivity; the positive relation between cognitive development and cortisol response was found in only infants with low AQS security scores. The findings may have important implications for research in the development of selfregulation in humans as well as in studies with animals. ß 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study examined the relationship between family demographics and EF subcomponents. A kindergarten sample was tested on subcomponents of working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility. Parents provided information on demographic variables. For 78 children both EF and demographic data were available. First, demographic profiles were identified within the sample. Two profiles were found: A low-risk profile of mainly two-biological-parent, high-income families with a highly educated mother who did not smoke during pregnancy and a high-risk profile of low-income families with a young, low-educated mother who more often smoked during pregnancy. Second, children with different demographic profiles were compared on EF subcomponents. Results indicate differential relations between family demographics and EF subcomponents: Whereas for most EF subcomponents no association with family demographics was found, high-risk children performed better on response shifting and tended to perform worse on verbal memory than low-risk children. Parenting stress decreased performance only for high-risk children. Although this study found limited impact of family demographics for EF, further longitudinal research can provide nuanced insights about which factors influence specific EF subcomponents during which developmental periods and guide targeted prevention of EF difficulties.},

At 16 and at 22 months, 125 first-born girls from middle-class families were observed in their homes and in the laboratory. Committed compliance was assessed in a clean-up task ('do' task), and in a task in which the children were asked to refrain from touching attractive toys ('don't' task). Temperamental fearfulness was observed when the children were confronted with seven somewhat scary items, such as a stethoscope and a rubber bird of prey. Attachment security was assessed with the Strange Situation procedure, and parental discipline and sensitivity measures were derived from home and lab observations in problem-solving and limit-setting situations. Maternal sensitivity during a puzzle task was related to more compliance of the child to her prohibitions, and maternal intrusiveness was associated with less compliance to maternal requests. Committed compliance was associated with concurrent parenting, attachment, and temperament. Controlling for concurrent parenting, attachment, and temperament, we did not find any significant associations between antecedent parenting and later compliance. Our data failed to support Kochanska's (1995, 1997) model of the impact of antecedent socialization and temperament on emergent morality.}

A randomized controlled trial was done to compare basic Developmental Care (standardized nests and incubator covers) and controls (standard care). Parents of infants born {$<$}32 weeks of gestation completed questionnaires measuring child behaviour and parental stress at 1 year (N = 139) and 2 years (N = 133) of the child's age. Parental stress was measured using the Nijmegen Parenting Stress Index and child behaviour was measured using the Infant–Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) and the Child Behaviour Checklist 2–3. At 1 year of age, children in the basic developmental care group had significantly higher behaviour scores on the total competence domain (p = .009) and the competence subscale mastery motivation (p = .002) of the ITSEA questionnaire, meaning that the infants showed more curiosity, persistence, obedience and enjoyment with small accomplishments. No significant effects were found on problem behaviour or parenting stress. We conclude that introducing a basic form of developmental care in the neonatal intensive care unit has a positive influence on the child's competence behaviour at 1 year of age.}

Some studies found a three-factor structure of inhibition, shifting, and updating, but others could not replicate this finding. We assumed that the task choices and scoring methods might be responsible for these contradictory findings. Therefore, we selected tasks in which input modality was varied, controlled for baseline speed, and used both speed and accuracy scores, in order to investigate whether a three factor model with inhibition, shifting, and updating could still be replicated. In a group of 211 children, who were tested at the beginning of grade 1, at approximately 6 years of age, and again after 18 months, the best fitting model was not the three-factor model, but instead consisted of an updating factor and a combined inhibition and shifting factor, besides two baseline speed factors (verbal and motor). We argue that these results might indicate that the structural organization of executive functions might be different in children than in adults, but that there might also be an alternative explanation: the distinction in executive functions might not accurately represent cognitive structures but instead be a methodological artefact.}

Yet that cannot be a sufficient explanation of children's problems with conceptualizing knowledge, because rule underextension occurs in children's claims to know something that they have not seen (nor inferred). The two errors were studied together with pairs of children aged 4 and 5 years. Each child had their own box, items on the table were shared out into the boxes, and either both children, or neither, or one of them, looked in their own box. Children were asked if they and the other knew what was in each other's box; and were asked for explanations and predictions. About a quarter of the children showed full competence. In others, overextension and underextension occurred; yet almost all children explained that inference was involved in knowing, without bias towards giving such explanation more for self than for other. Error patterns were not predictable from a test for understanding the term ‘know'. It is suggested that children have a framework conception of ‘knowing’ in which another's mind is treated as similar to own mind, but problems arise in implementing that insight before children manage to conceptualize constraints on knowledge.}

According to their PSE resilience to negative feedback during the task, they were grouped in a high resilient and low resilient group. PSE was followed up at 32 weeks of pregnancy and 3 and 12 months after birth, while perceived temperament of the child was assessed at 3 and 12 months after birth.

It argues in line with Bayne that intentional action is at least an equally valid criterion for awareness. This leads to a distinction between different levels of implicitness. Postulating these different levels, it is argued, allows us to make better sense of the empirical literature on early false-belief task abilities.}

Task-specific factors were tightly controlled using the same task for both modes of learning. The implicit learning task was based on the manipulation of a graphic production principle. Our procedure trained participants to reverse the principle. In the explicit task, participants had to learn the two rules that account for this reversed principle. Whether they were trained implicitly or explicitly, participants then performed the same test in which the impact of their training was assessed. Children with DS performed as well as controls in the implicit learning condition. They benefited less from the explicit learning condition than controls. They appeared to be impaired in the ability to recollect explicit information about the implicit training situation in comparison with controls. These results are discussed in the light of the current literature on the implicit and explicit modes of learning, and hypotheses are formulated about specific information processes that may be impaired in individuals with DS.}

  abstract = {Young children in immigrant families tend to face more challenges and can often call upon fewer resources than their native-born peers. This situation adversely affects their social–emotional development. In this study, the development of emotion knowledge of 576 immigrant and native-born German children, aged 3–6 years, was compared at three time points over a 12-month period by means of a latent growth curve analysis. Language abilities and behavioural self-regulation were examined as mediators of the relation between immigration background and emotion knowledge. The immigrant children showed less emotion knowledge than did their native-born peers at each point of measurement. These effects were partially mediated by their behavioural self-regulation and their language abilities. How behavioural self-regulation and language abilities affect the development of emotion knowledge and what this effect means for interventions are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Emotion knowledge develops rapidly between the ages of three and six. Emotion knowledge develops similarly in different cultures. What does this study adds? This study compares the development of emotion knowledge between immigrant children and native-born children. It includes language skills as mediator on the development of emotion knowledge. It also includes behavioural self-regulation as mediator on the development of emotion knowledge.},

Data from 803 children (45.8\% female; M = 54 months; 39.1\% Caucasian, 26.3\% African American, 24.6\% Hispanic, 9.9\% Other) were collected at fall and spring of the preschool year, and classroom observations were conducted three times throughout the year. Multilevel models tested associations between classroom behaviors of teachers and students using the Classroom Observation in Preschool and the Teacher Observation in Preschool and gains children made in a CSR composite score (Dimensional Change Card Sort, Peg Tapping, Head Toes Knees Shoulders, Copy Design, and Corsi Blocks) across the preschool year. After controlling for demographic covariates and children's pretest scores, both affective and cognitive classroom processes were associated with gains. More teacher behavior approving, less disapproving, and more positive emotional tone were associated with gains. The proportion of observed time teachers spent delivering instruction as well as the proportion of time children were involved with mathematics and literacy were also related to CSR gains, as was the quality of teacher instruction. Although exploratory, these results highlight the potential for modifications in classroom practices to aid in children's CSR development.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between the ability to discriminate and produce facial expressions and social acceptance by peers of young preschool children. Multiple measurements of affect discrimination ability, production ability (posed and spontaneous) and sociometric status (ratings and preference scores) were included, along with one measure of verbal labelling of affective expressions. Results indicated that abilities to discriminate and produce expressions were unrelated when the contribution of age and IQ to the relation was removed. Furthermore, posed and spontaneous productions of expressions were not related. Sociometric preference scores but not rating scores were predicted by the ability to discriminate affective expressions (R2 = .68). Sociometric preference scores were also predicted by spontaneous expressivity scores (R2 = .38) but not by the ability to pose affective expressions. No gender differences were observed on any measures. Thus, results indicate that children's discrimination ability and spontaneous expressivity predict social competence, as indexed by liking by peers. Results are discussed in terms of a social information processing model of social competence.}

Currently, many measures of EF lack applicability to daily life, or ecological validity. The aim of this scoping review was to examine two aspects of ecological validity across measures, assessments, and tasks of EF in children. A scoping review of 355 peer-reviewed articles published between 1996 and 2016 was performed. Searching revealed 43 articles addressing the ecological validity of EF measures for children and 40 measures addressing ecological validity. An increasing number of articles address ecological validity of EF measures. Future research should address the interplay between context and EF performance. In addition, research should begin recognizing the importance of parental involvement in assessments, as well as ways to capture the EF strengths of children.},

The dissociation between the two kinds of understanding was robust despite direct false-belief test questions using a Mandarin specific think-falsely verb and despite participants living in a culture that promotes early self-control. Children showed coherent AL across different belief-formation scenarios. Manipulation of inhibitory demand in the false-belief task did not affect preschoolers’ verbal judgments any more than their AL, and yet separate measures executive function correlated only with direct judgments and not looking responses. The findings are discussed in terms of an implicit–explicit cognitive systems account of false-belief understanding.}

Sociometric ratings were obtained from a sample of 131 9–10-year-old children drawn from two matched schools. Each child also completed a newly developed and empirically derived Social Behaviour Questionnaire. This questionnaire led to the identification of 21 prosocial children, 23 bullies and 14 victims of bullying. Children in these subgroups were then assessed on measures of empathy and social problem-solving. Prosocial children were significantly more popular than the other role groups, and bully-victims were most frequently rejected by their peers. Prosocial children also showed greater empathic awareness than either bullies or victims, but gender was the significant source of variance. Prosocial children and victims responded more constructively than did bullies to socially awkward situations, and bullies were less aware than prosocial children of the possible negative consequences of their solution strategies.}

Eighty-seven children, aged 10–12 years old, completed peer-nomination measures of social behaviour. On the basis of numbers of social nominations received, a subsample of 51 children (32 who were peer-nominated as ‘prosocial’, and 18 who were peer-nominated as ‘antisocial’) then recorded their perceptions of peers' motives for prosocial behaviours. Expressed motives were categorized predominantly into three categories, coinciding with Turiel's (1978) ‘moral’, ‘conventional’, and ‘personal domains’. Results indicate that children's social reputation is associated with the extent to which they perceive peers' prosocial motives as ‘personal’ or ‘moral’, with more prosocial children attributing moral motives, and more antisocial children attributing personal motives. Although traditionally Turiel's domain theory has been used to understand ‘antisocial’ children's behaviour, the current findings suggest that ‘prosocial’ children's behaviour may also be related to domains of judgment.}

Task support was provided by an expert adult who both managed the task and provided verbal assistance. Two hundred subjects, 20 males and 20 females in each of five age groups (preschool, grade 1, grade 3, grade 5, adult) participated. There were four treatment groups which received increasing amounts of support, ranging from a base level of practical experience with the scale sequencing of items, elaborated instructions and prompts. Task understanding was assessed by two measures derived from Siegler's (1976) rule assessment approach and results indicated significant differences due to treatment. Increasing amounts of assistance led to improved understanding of the balance scale principles, although the addition of verbal assistance resulted in a highly significant improvement, over and above the gains resulting from the combined influence of task management features. These treatment effects were consistent across age and sex.}

Most early coregulatory interactions aim to manage fluctuations in the infant's arousal and alertness; but over time, coregulatory processes become progressively elaborated to encompass other functions such as sociocommunicative development, attention and executive control. The fundamental aim of coregulation is to help maintain an optimal ‘critical state’ between hypo‐ and hyperactivity. Here, we present a dynamic framework for understanding child–caregiver coregulatory interactions in the context of psychopathology. Early coregulatory processes involve both passive entrainment, through which a child's state entrains to the caregiver's, and active contingent responsiveness, through which the caregiver changes their behaviour in response to behaviours from the child. Similar principles, of interactive but asymmetric contingency, drive joint attention and the maintenance of epistemic states as well as arousal/alertness, emotion regulation and sociocommunicative development. We describe three ways in which active child–caregiver regulation can develop atypically, in conditions such as Autism, ADHD, anxiety and depression. The most well‐known of these is insufficient contingent responsiveness, leading to reduced synchrony, which has been shown across a range of modalities in different disorders, and which is the target of most current interventions. We also present evidence that excessive contingent responsiveness and excessive synchrony can develop in some circumstances. And we show that positive feedback interactions can develop, which are contingent but mutually amplificatory child–caregiver interactions that drive the child further from their critical state.

Mental self-rotation is a process of rotating an embodied representational self through mental simulation of the sensorimotor mechanisms underlying actual self-movement. It was predicted that physical development would affect the operation of the representational self. One hundred and twenty-five individuals aged 5–80 years (57 children, 35 students, and 33 elderly people) executed a video game task of spatial perspective taking in three conditions of sensorimotor activation: A restrained, stable, and unstable condition. In the linear function formulas considering the degree of rotation and response times, the gradient represented the theoretical speed of mental self-rotation and the intercept represented other cognitive processing. A significant interaction was found between age group and condition on the gradients, indicating that the response times in the unstable condition were faster than in the other conditions for the children, the restrained condition was slower than the other conditions for the students, while no difference was found for the elderly adults. The results suggest that the influence of sensorimotor activation on the embodied representational self depends on developmental changes in physical control.},

Children with more advanced social-cognitive abilities engaged in fewer acts of physical aggression; however, much of the ability of the social-cognitive variables to predict physical aggression was shared with language ability. In addition, social-cognitive understanding moderated the connection between language ability and physical aggression. Exploratory examination of gender differences in patterns of association between physical aggression and the social cognitive understanding variables revealed that the relationships were only true for boys. Relational aggression was not associated with social cognitive ability for either boys or girls, but this is likely due to the low frequency of relationally aggressive behaviour observed in this sample.}

We developed a two-part procedure for eliciting children's responses to closed-ended and open-ended questions about interpersonal vignettes presented in storyboard format, and we employed this method in a preliminary investigation with a sample of 62 intellectually gifted boys and girls aged 7–8 and 10–11. The results showed that the participants understood that defensive interpersonal behaviours affect the likelihood that feared and wished-for short-term outcomes will occur. Participants demonstrated that they understood that people behave defensively in order to avoid feared consequences and nondefensively in order to pursue wished-for outcomes. Findings also indicated that older participants understood that a person is more likely to behave defensively in highly conflict-ridden situations. The results suggest that our method provides the basis for research that complements previous studies of children's understanding of how intrapsychic defence mechanisms regulate a person's affective experience. Future research using this method could investigate the role of beliefs about defensive behaviour in the development of behaviour problems.}

  abstract = {This study aimed to extend earlier work (Wilding, Munir, \& Cornish, 2001; Wilding, 2003) which showed that children (aged 6–15) who were rated by their teachers as having poor attentional ability made more errors on a visual search task than children rated as having good attentional ability. The present study used a simpler version of the search task which had previously been used to study attention in children with Fragile X syndrome (Scerif, Cornish, Wilding, Driver, \& Karmiloff-Smith, 2004) and studied performance in normal children from a younger age group. Children aged 3 and 4 were rated by teachers for attention and hyperactivity. Regression analyses, with verbal mental age (VMA), chronological age (CA), and attention rating as independent variables, found that children with higher VMA made fewer false alarms in visual searches, as did children given a better attention rating. However, none of the independent variables was related to time or distance travelled for correct responses. The relation between attention rating and error rate was non-linear, with the error rate increasing once the attention rating fell below the mean. The results are discussed in relation to explanations of poor attention in terms of weak inhibition.}

  abstract = {Explanations of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in terms of a weakness in Executive Function (EF) or related concepts, such as inhibition, are briefly reviewed. Some alternative views are considered, in particular a proposal by Manly and others that ADHD is a weakness primarily of sustained attention (plus control of attention), but not of selective attention, as measured by the Test of Everyday Attention in Children (TEA-Ch; Manly et al., 2001). The underlying structure of the TEA-Ch is analysed and it is concluded that the distinction between selective attention, sustained attention, and control of attention in this battery is not well-founded. Furthermore, evidence from studies by Wilding and others, from visual search tasks similar to those employed by Manly et al. to measure selective attention, demonstrates that, while unimpaired- and impaired-attention groups do not differ in speed of performance on such tasks (the measure employed in the TEA-Ch), they do differ reliably in accuracy. Available evidence from other visual search tasks comparing such groups is reviewed and found to be inconsistent. An attempt is made to resolve the inconsistencies and it is suggested that search tasks including demands that engage EF processes are more likely to demonstrate differences between these groups. It is concluded therefore that the most plausible explanation at present of impaired attention is in terms of weaknesses in EF. Suggestions for improving the precision and detail of this type of explanation are offered.}

Preschool children watched videos of an individual and a group member. The individual always demonstrated a successful instrumental action and the group member an unsuccessful action that was either causally transparent or opaque. Highlighting the selective nature of social learning, children copied the group at higher rates when the demonstrated actions were causally opaque than when they were causally transparent. This research draws attention to the influence of conventional/ritual-like actions on young children's learning choices and emphasizes the role of this orientation in the development of human-specific cumulative culture.},

The first task required participants to predict and explain feature outcomes in both an offspring and a sibling, in a modified version of the phenotypic similarity task. In the second task, participants offered explanations for instances of parent-offspring dissimilarity and grandparent-offspring resemblance (phenotypic difference task). The inclusion of two tasks and a broad age range revealed significant age trends between 4 and 10 years in naïve inheritance concepts. However, there was little consistency in children's inheritance explanations within or across tasks. The findings are discussed with reference to debates concerning the development and structure of naïve biology concepts.}

The causal mechanisms task asked participants to rate their preference for various mechanisms of inheritance for physical features. The family relatedness task required participants to provide judgements on the relatedness of family members and explain their understanding of kinship terms.

There was a trend towards increased consistency in judgements across tasks with age, but low correlations between explanations given in different task contexts. Findings are discussed with reference to the onset and variability of inheritance concepts and the implications for education and future research.}

  abstract = {A large body of autism research over the last 20 years has shown that people with autism have difficulties understanding mental states. This has been conceived of as a metarepresentational deficit. An open question is whether people with autism's metarepresentational deficit is limited to the mental domain. This research explores individuals with autism's understanding of the representational nature of pictures. With the use of ambiguous figures, where a single stimulus is capable of representing two distinct referents, we compared metarepresentational abilities in the pictorial and mental domains and the perception of pictorial ambiguity. Our findings indicate that individuals with autism are impaired in mental metarepresentation but not in pictorial metarepresentation. These findings suggest that children with autism understand the representational nature of pictures. We conclude that children with autism's understanding of the representational nature of pictures is in advance of their metarepresentational understanding of mind. Their perception of figure ambiguity is comparable to the typical population.}

Recent years have seen a large increase in SEMs in the behavioral science literature, but consideration of sample size requirements for applied SEMs often relies on outdated rules-of-thumb. This study used Monte Carlo data simulation techniques to evaluate sample size requirements for common applied SEMs. Across a series of simulations, we systematically varied key model properties, including number of indicators and factors, magnitude of factor loadings and path coefficients, and amount of missing data. We investigated how changes in these parameters affected sample size requirements with respect to statistical power, bias in the parameter estimates, and overall solution propriety. Results revealed a range of sample size requirements (i.e., from 30 to 460 cases), meaningful patterns of association between parameters and sample size, and highlight the limitations of commonly cited rules-of-thumb. The broad “lessons learned” for determining SEM sample size requirements are discussed.},

Children's perception of the degree of social hierarchical structuring and social prominence in their class was determined by peer nominations. 432 children participated in the follow-up either 2 or 4 years after baseline aged 10–11 (year 6) and completed a bullying questionnaire. Relational victims and children from classes with a high hierarchical structure were more likely to have dropped out of the study compared to neutral children, and children from classes with a low hierarchical structure. Relative risk analyses indicated a twofold increased risk of remaining a direct victim at follow-up, compared to a child not involved at baseline becoming a victim over the follow-up period. In contrast, relational victimization increased but was not found to be stable. Logistic regression analyses revealed that being a girl, and receiving few positive peer nominations predicted remaining a direct victim. Becoming a relational victim at follow-up was predicted by a strong class hierarchy. The implications for future study of early recognition of likely long term victims and early preventative bullying initiatives are discussed.}

  abstract = {The WJ-R provides a wide age range and comprehensive set of cognitive measures. A major interpretation feature of the battery is the provision of eight factor scores, each based on two measures. The theoretical basis for the tests is founded in Gf-Gc theory, work that is often associated with Raymond Cattell and John Horn, although other scholars think and write about intelligence in a similar vein. This report is a brief review of the theory followed by the results of several factor analytic studies. Nine data sets drawn from the 1977 and 1989 norming and concurrent validity studies have been analyzed. In the concurrent studies, the WJ-R cognitive tests were administered in conjunction with other major batteries including the K-ABC, the SB-IV, the WISC-R, and the WAIS-R. Altogether, 15 sets of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses that included a total of 68 variables were completed. The results of all studies provide support for the WJ-R eight-factor model of Gf-Gc theory. As a byproduct of the procedure, comparative information was observed for the congruence of other cognitive batteries to the Gf-Gc theory. It is suggested that the other cognitive batteries often have been underfactored, which has led to misinterpretation of their factorial structures. This report demonstrates the need for factor analytic studies in which the set of variables is not constrained to the limited set of subtests that have been published together as a battery. It is indicated that the set of variables to be included in a factor study must include enough breadth and depth of markers to ensure that the presence of all major factor effects can be identified.},

This research examined the role of individual differences in memory capacity in the production and effectiveness of a selective processing strategy. Kindergartners and first graders (N = 84) chose, by opening doors, certain objects to view from a set of objects during a study period. The most appropriate strategy was a selective one - viewing only the objects to be recalled. Individual differences in capacity were assessed by five measures of memory span. Several measures of capacity predicted recall overall or strategy effectiveness, but none were related to strategy production. The fact that digit span predicted recall for strategic children, but not non-strategic children, suggests that those strategic children who have a relatively large capacity can engage in additional mnemonic activities that increase recall.}

Rather than relying on verbal response measures, as has been done in the past, children's creative and inferential pretend actions were used as indicators of their understanding. The common structure to all four studies was that children were confronted with one pretend scenario, moved to a second pretend scenario and then back again to the first. Children proficiently tailored their pretence to an object whose pretend identity changed between scenarios despite being less able to name each identity. Thus, using an inferential action methodology, these studies provide early and particularly convincing evidence that children can track the multiple pretend identities of objects.}

  abstract = {In this work, we introduce ChatQA 2, an Llama 3.0-based model with a 128K context window, designed to bridge the gap between open-source LLMs and leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09) in long context understanding and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These two capabilities are complementary to each other and essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K and 128K benchmarks.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The temporal structure of behavior contains a rich source of information about its dynamic organization, origins, and development. Today, advances in sensing and data storage allow researchers to collect multiple dimensions of behavioral data at a fine temporal scale both in and out of the laboratory, leading to the curation of massive multimodal corpora of behavior. However, along with these new opportunities come new challenges. Theories are often underspecified as to the exact nature of these unfolding interactions, and psychologists have limited ready-to-use methods and training for quantifying structures and patterns in behavioral time series. In this paper, we will introduce four techniques to interpret and analyze high-density multi-modal behavior data, namely, to: (1) visualize the raw time series, (2) describe the overall distributional structure of temporal events (Burstiness calculation), (3) characterize the non-linear dynamics over multiple timescales with Chromatic and Anisotropic Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA), (4) and quantify the directional relations among a set of interdependent multimodal behavioral variables with Granger Causality. Each technique is introduced in a module with conceptual background, sample data drawn from empirical studies and ready-to-use Matlab scripts. The code modules showcase each technique’s application with detailed documentation to allow more advanced users to adapt them to their own datasets. Additionally, to make our modules more accessible to beginner programmers, we provide a “Programming Basics” module that introduces common functions for working with behavioral timeseries data in Matlab. Together, the materials provide a practical introduction to a range of analyses that psychologists can use to discover temporal structure in high-density behavioral data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Participants were 731 Chinese high school students in grade 10 (356 boys; Mage = 15.64 years, SD = 0.68). Two waves of 1-year longitudinal data were collected using student reports of parental psychological control and academic-related beliefs, strategies, and behaviours. Results showed that parental psychological control at Time 1 significantly triggered an increase in students’ maladaptive academic functioning at Time 2; and students’ adaptive academic functioning at Time 1 significantly predicted parental psychological control at Time 2. Limitations of the present study and implications for practice are discussed. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? According to self-determination theory, parental psychological control has been found to be harmful on students’ academic learning in Western societies. We know little about the relation between parental psychological control and academic functioning (adaptive vs. maladaptive) in Eastern societies such as China. What does this study add? Parental psychological control increased maladaptive academic functioning, and adaptive academic functioning decreased parental psychological control, suggesting a more fluid, dynamic parenting–child interaction over time. The predicted relations between parental psychological control and academic functioning of high school students hold across gender. More urbanized adolescents had a high tendency to perceive their parents as psychological controlling, suggesting a change in culture regarding the importance of personal autonomy for more urbanized adolescents.},

  abstract = {An understanding of intentionality is thought to underlie developing joint attention. Similarly, early social-communicative behaviours have been argued to reflect an appreciation of adult intentionality. This study explored the relation between social-communicative behaviours during the still-face effect at 6 months and joint attention at 12 months in a longitudinal sample of 42 infants. Three types of joint attention were investigated: coordinated joint attention (infant alternates looks between an adult and objects), initiating joint attention (infant uses communicative gestures to engage or direct adult attention) and attention following (infant follows an adult's line of gaze and pointing towards an object). The still-face effect was correlated with later attention following, but not coordinated or initiating joint attention. Initiating joint attention was correlated with coordinated joint attention. We propose that the former association reflects a lower-level detection of adult intentionality rather than a higher-level interpretation of an agent's intentions towards outside entities. The findings support two bodies of research – one advocating for a distinction between types of joint attentional ability and a second proposing that infants can detect intentional actions without understanding or attributing mental states to objects.}

We collected data from 9- and 12-month-old infants during perception of means-end actions made with a tool and during execution of their own grasps. We computed event-related desynchronization (ERD) during perception and production events and assessed infants' reach-grasp competence by looking at their latency to complete grasps. Although we found greater ERD during perception of means-end actions in 9-month-olds compared with 12-month-olds, we found the relation between ERD during perception and emerging reach-grasp competence to be specific for 12-month-olds and not for 9-month-olds.

  abstract = {It has been suggested that infants’ performance on the false belief task can be explained by the use of behavioural rules. To test this hypothesis, 18-month-old infants were trained to learn the new rule that an object that disappeared in location A could be found in location B. Infants were then administered a false belief task based on the violation of expectation (VOE) paradigm, an intention understanding task, and a modified detour-reaching task. Results revealed that infants looked significantly longer at the display when the experimenter looked for the toy in the full box (box with the toy) compared to infants who observed the experimenter search in the empty box (box without the toy). Results also revealed significant correlations between infants’ looking time at the display and their scores on the intention task and on the detour-reaching task. Taken together, these findings suggest that infants possess an implicit understanding of false belief. In addition, they challenge the view that success on the implicit false belief task does not require executive functioning abilities.}

Children and adults performed faster on analogical reasoning tasks when they were primed by Stroop tasks. This priming effect was found to be stronger in children than in adults. In Experiment 2, 25 seven-year-olds, 28 nine-year-olds, and 28 adults completed relative number matching tasks, a more task-relevant inhibitory control task, before analogical reasoning tasks. The children and adults performed faster on analogical reasoning tasks when primed by relative number matching tasks.

Participants were 212 preschoolers (Mage = 58.32 months, SD = 10.72). Children provided self-reports of empathetic feelings, parents rated child shyness and empathic behaviours (e.g., reparative behaviours), and teachers assessed indices of socio-emotional functioning (e.g., prosocial behaviours). Results revealed interaction effects between empathic feelings and shyness in the prediction of outcome variables. Among children with lower levels of shyness, empathy rated by children was positively related to empathetic and reparative behaviours (rated by parents) and prosocial behaviours (rated by teachers). At higher levels of shyness, these relations were attenuated. These results can be interpreted to suggest that although shy children may not differ from their more sociable counterparts in experiencing empathy, they seem to be less likely to act empathically.},

However, the assessment of maternal interpretations has generally proceeded in an indirect fashion. The present study sought to assess maternal interpretations in a more direct manner. Sixty primiparous mothers of 4- or 8-month-old infants viewed video clips of unfamiliar infants engaged in social-, object- or non-directed activities and rated the actions for perceived intentionality. Results indicated that mothers of younger infants assigned more intentionality to social behaviours than did mothers of older infants, suggesting that maternal interpretations change over the course of infant development. Explanations for this pattern are explored, including the possibility that mothers become less sensitive to established behaviours or that they use a type of moving threshold to judge infant actions. Future avenues of research are suggested.}

  abstract = {In long-term studies of psychological development, the initial assessment of etiologically significant child behaviours is often carried out at a single point in time only. However, one-time assessments of behaviour are likely to possess limited reliability, leading to attenuated longitudinal correlation coefficient magnitudes. How much this bias might have affected behavioural continuity estimates in longitudinal research is presently unknown. Using a data set from the Mauritius Child Health Project, we particularize the attenuating effects of single-occasion behavioural assessments on consistency estimates of impulsive–aggressive behaviour over time. Specifically, two nursery teachers provided 15 consecutive weekly ratings of the aggressive behaviour of 99 four-year-old children. The same children were reassessed for the presence of externalizing behaviour problems at the ages of 8 and 10. There were substantial increases in both reliability and predictive correlation coefficient magnitudes when the preschool scores were aggregated across several weekly ratings. A further increase resulted after the two outcome assessments were combined into a composite score of school-age externalizing symptoms. A generalized procedure, developed from the correction for attenuation formula, is introduced to describe the relation of aggregation to predictive validity in longitudinal research.},

In four experiments we tested Karmiloff-Smith's (1992) claim that preschool children represent such knowledge as sequentially fixed lists by examining the extent to which they could vary their usual routine for drawing a picture of a man by adding a second head. Participants were mainly white, lower middle-class boys and girls, aged 3 years to 9 years, living in the suburbs of a large city. We found more flexibility on this task than has previously been claimed and evidence that misconstrual of the task may account for some children appearing inflexible in previous studies. Nevertheless, a substantial number of young children did display a degree of inflexibility that was (1) relatively stable over time, (2) hard to account for in terms of misunderstanding of the task, and (3) not simply unwillingness to attempt novel drawings. Furthermore, this inflexibility was unrelated to drawing style within age groups, but declined with increasing age. While this apparent inflexibility could be interpreted as a consequence of internal cognitive constraints, it could also be explained as an attempt to maintain a symmetrical composition. We conclude, therefore, that the currently available data provide only qualified support for the operation of internal constraints on the flexibility of sequences of skilled actions.}

One hundred twelve adults aged 60–90 participated in an online daily diary study for nine consecutive days. On Day 1, they reported demographic information. On Days 2–9, they reported daily AARC, subjective age, and stressors and completed three tasks that gauged memory (word recall), perceptual speed (number comparison), and reasoning (letter series), respectively, once per day. Unconditional multilevel models revealed significant within-person fluctuations in daily cognitive performance and daily AARC. Controlling for age, education, health, and daily stressors, daily awareness of age-related losses was negatively associated with letter series scores of the same day and changes from one day to the next.

Observations were made in their homes when they were playing and reading books with their mothers. The initial predominance of acts declined while gestures increased from 10 to 18 months. The gestural types differed in their time of emergence, frequency of use and the context in which they were used. Generally, there was a progressive increase in the coordination of gestures and vocalizations but differences were found in when and how often gestural types were accompanied by vocalizations. These vocalizations showed developmental changes from babbling and proto-words to single and then multi-word utterances. Initially, co-occurring gesture and vocalization expressed the same meaning but as the two modes came to be used to express diverse meanings, more complex ideas were conveyed. During the period when the number and functional flexibility of the child's words are limited, gestures play an important role in enhancing communicative effectiveness. The establishment of an integrated, plurifunctional and increasingly conventional signalling system seems to provide a supportive framework for the acquisition of linguistic signals.}
